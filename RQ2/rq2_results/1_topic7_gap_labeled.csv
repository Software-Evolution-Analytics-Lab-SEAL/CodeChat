This tab contains all risk factor group and risk factor guidance. Each guidance item is linked to the applicable risk factor group/risk factor on the ""RoMMs and Response"" tab.					
					
PROCEDURES TAB:				
""The """"Procedures"""" tab includes the suggested substantive procedures to address the corresponding suggested RoMM. The procedures associated with deliberative risks may be tailored for engagement-specific circumstances. However, the risk description and procedures are required to be tailored for significant risks. Each of the procedures is linked to the applicable RoMM on the """"RoMMs and Response"""" tab. 

Where there are multiple procedures suggested to address a RoMM, consider each procedure for applicability and, if applicable, select the suggested procedure. In many cases, the RoMM is appropriately addressed by the combination of audit evidence obtained through the performance of multiple suggested procedures. If the procedure titles within each procedure set begin with either “DW 1” or “DW 2,” teams are to select one of the Deloitte Ways and perform all procedures under that Deloitte Way.""

Problem Statement:
Currently, our platform lacks the ability to display information in a hierarchical manner. This limitation hinders the effective organization and presentation of data, making it difficult for users to navigate and understand the relationships between different entities.

Solution:
To address the problem stated above, we propose the implementation of a new feature called ""Display Group Hierarchy."" This feature will introduce the functionality to display information in a hierarchical structure within our platform. The key aspects of this feature include:
	• Hierarchical Data Representation: The platform will be enhanced to support the representation of data in a hierarchical format for up to 5 levels. This will allow for the creation of parent-child relationships between different entities, enabling users to better understand and navigate the data structure.
	• Configuration Settings: New configuration settings will be added to the platform to facilitate the setup and management of the display group hierarchy. This will allow users to define the hierarchy levels, specify the relationships between entities, and customize the display options.
	• Filtering Functionality: To complement the display group hierarchy, we will introduce filtering capabilities based on the different hierarchy levels. Users will be able to filter the displayed information by selecting specific hierarchy nodes, enabling them to focus on relevant subsets of data.

Acceptance Criteria:
Hierarchical Data Representation:
	• The platform must support the creation of a hierarchical structure for up to 5 levels.
	• Users should be able to define parent-child relationships between entities within the hierarchy.
	• The platform must visually display the hierarchy in a tree-like structure or similar format that clearly indicates the levels and relationships.
	• Users must be able to expand or collapse nodes within the hierarchy to view or hide child entities.
	• The platform must support the movement or reassignment of entities within the hierarchy without loss of data.

Filtering Functionality:
	• Filter functionality should be displayed within the display settings when display group hierarchy is enabled for an attribute.
	• The filter interface should allow users to select nodes at any level to apply filter criteria.
	• Then number of filters displayed should be equal to the number of levels of hierarchies enabled for an attribute.
	• Users should be able to apply multiple filters across different hierarchy levels simultaneously.
	• Upon applying a filter, the platform must display only the entities that fall under the selected node(s), including their child entities if applicable.
	• If a filter is applied to a parent node, all child nodes and their associated entities must be included in the filtered results unless specifically excluded by the user.
	• The platform should allow users to include or exclude child nodes selectively when applying filters at a parent level.
	• The current active filters must be visibly indicated to the user in the hierarchy view.
	• Users must have the option to clear individual filters or all filters at once.
	• Users should be able to modify active filters without having to clear them first and reapply.
	• The state of applied filters should persist during the user's session or until the user explicitly clears them.
	• The platform should remember the user's last-used filter settings upon returning to the hierarchy view within the same session.

Configuration:
Add new process configurations for hierarchies. 


What I am trying to do is enable a way to display information in a hierarchical format for all key attributes that are enabled. And we are going to allow a maxiumum of 5 levels of hierarchy. Can you optimize the ticket I shared based on this information.",3,Incremental Problem Solving

This can be seen even today with our current newer cars, when it comes to tuning a new car, a lot of programming is required in order to tweak the fuel/air mixture and the timing of the engine, it is not as simple as getting a wrench or screwdriver to tune a car anymore. As things have become more sophisticated, people must learn new skills in order to continue making progress, and this wouldn't be any different with flying cars, we would still need people to work on the physical engines themselves, but also to tweak with the computers inside the engine.

I think that technology and the future of the workforce will certainly change, as technology becomes more sophisticated, certain professions will become obsolete, and others will increase in demand.  I believe that the programming experience that we are gaining will help us in the future to help with this transition, as technology starts to advance, there will still be a need for people to monitor these programs when errors arise. One area that has become affected by the progression of technology is Data Science, as machine learning has become more advanced and AI is becoming more sophisticated, the utilization of AI is growing more and more.

324d60cf0c1a583e30f1dde368b9ba38,1,"To create a feature complete REST API for time scheduling.
Tech requirements
Use an SQL Database with an ORM
Store data in related tables with foreign keys, don’t use json columns
Use a high level Javascript or PHP framework (NestJS, Laravel, Symfony, …)
Scope
Only backend APIs are in the scope of this hackathon, No frontend HTML/JS/CSS should be created.
User stories
As a user, I would like to book an appointment
As a user, I would like to select the date and see all available slots for this day
As a user, I want to open the scheduling page and book appointments for multiple people at once (think of
booking a haircut for yourself and your two kids)
Business stories
As a business administrator, I want to allow users to book for an appointment for available services.
As a business administrator, I want to show a calendar to users, with all available slots for booking for all
available services.
As a business administrator, I want to configure my bookable schedule (bookable calendar) for different
services all user stories below
Example: As an owner of Hair saloon, I want to create an online bookable calendar for Men haircut,
Women haircut and Hair colouring services.
As a business administrator, I want to configure opening hours which can differ from day to day
Example:
Monday to Friday men haircut can be booked from 08:00 to 20:00, and Women haircut can be booked
from 10:00 to 22:00
on Saturday, men haircut and women haircut, can be booked from 10:00 to 22:00
As a business administrator, I want to configure the duration of appointment that can be booked by users.
Example: For Men haircut, An appointment can be of 30 minutes and For Women haircut, An
appointment can be of 60 minutes.
As a business administrator, I want to have a configurable break between appointments.
Example: 5 minutes to clean the shop before next appointment of Men haircut, and 10 minutes to clean up
before next Women haircut.
As a business administrator, I want to allow users to book a time slot in x days in future but not for more
than x days, where x is configurable number of days.
Example: If a user tries to book a slot today, they can be allowed to book for 7 days in future but not for
8th day.
As a business administrator, I want to configure one or more breaks (Off time) when a service can’t be
booked.
Example: Lunch break 12:00 - 13:00, Coffee Break 17:00 - 17:30 etc.
As a business administrator, I want that a configurable number (1 or more) of clients can book one time
slot.
Example: A hair saloon, can serve 5 men haircuts and 3 women haircuts at same time.
As a business administrator, I would like to specify date and time duration when business is would be off,
these are different from weekly off. (These are planned off date and time duration.)
Example: Men and women haircut service, would remain closed in second half Christmas, full day on Eid
and Diwali. Women haircut service would remain closed on 25th January because our women’s hair
expert is on leave.
As a business administrator, I don’t want to allow users to book for an invalid slot. A requested slot is
invalid -
if requested slot is booked out
if requested slot doesn’t exist in bookable calendar
if requested slot falls between configured breaks
if requested slot falls between configured break between appointments.
if requested slot falls on a planned off date and time duration.
As a business administrator, I want to create multiple scheduling events with totally different
configurations (Men haircut, Women haircut, hair colouring, etc)
As a business administrator, I want those different events to be totally separate
As a business administrator, I want users to specify their personal details (First name, last name and email
address) for each individual in booking request.
Example: If a booking request is created for 3 people, booking request must contain 3 person’s details.
As a business administrator, I want to allow a person to book multiple times without any unique
restriction.
Example: A user should be allowed to make booking for 3 people, even if they don’t know the person’s
details, in such case they can copy their own details.
As another developer I want peace of mind and just run the automated test suite and know that I did not
break anything
Acceptance criteria
A time scheduling JSON based Rest API should be created
1 GET api which provides all data an SPA might need to display a calendar and a time selection.
1 POST api which creates a booking for 1 or more people for a single time slot
API should accept single slot for which booking needs to be created.
API should accept personal details (Email, First name and Last name) of one or multiple people to be
booked.
Implement automated testing that ensures the functionality of your code
Important: don’t trust the frontend, validate the data so that the API returns an exception in case
something does not fit into the schema or is already booked out
For a men haircut
booking should not be possible at 7am because its before the shop opens.
booking at 8:02 should not be possible because its not fitting in any slot.
booking at 12:15 should not be possible as its lunch break.
…
Seed your database with the following scheduling using seeder files

It attributes the recent struggles of value investing strategies to the increasing dominance of intangibles, which are not adequately captured by traditional measures of tangible value.

The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the shift from tangible to intangible value. It delves into the historical evolution of value investing, acknowledging the contributions of Ben Graham, whose principles were established during the industrial age. The authors emphasize that the economy has transformed into an information-based system, where firms derive their value primarily from intangible assets rather than physical assets.

To address this issue, the paper proposes a new framework for calculating intrinsic value that accounts for both tangible and intangible assets. It recognizes that measuring intangibles is complex due to the limitations of standardized accounting practices. Therefore, the authors advocate for the use of alternative data and machine learning techniques to quantify these intangibles effectively.

The development of an Intangible Value measure is a key contribution of the paper. This measure aims to capture the combined value of various intangible assets, such as intellectual property, human capital, brand equity, and network effects. The authors explain the process of creating this measure, which involves clustering analysis and topic modeling of their previous research work.

Using this Intangible Value metric alongside traditional tangible value metrics, the authors backtest investment strategies and portfolios. They demonstrate that incorporating intangible value enhances the performance of value investing, outpacing strategies that rely solely on tangible value. The paper also presents a visual decomposition of the balance sheets of prominent companies, illustrating the significance of intangible assets.

In addition to the practical implications, the paper discusses the philosophical aspects of value and growth investing. It critiques the rigid style box framework that categorizes investments as either value or growth, suggesting that this binary classification is outdated and restrictive. The authors align with Warren Buffett's perspective, emphasizing that growth is an essential component of value and that a dynamic approach is needed to adapt to changing market opportunities.

The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for value investing to evolve. It advocates for a more inclusive definition of intrinsic value that unites the value and growth investing communities. By embracing the reality of the intangibles-driven economy and leveraging new data and technologies, the authors believe that value investing can regain its prominence.

This expanded summary captures the key points of the research paper, including its analysis of the evolving economic landscape, the proposed framework for measuring intangible value, and the potential for a more holistic approach to investing that transcends traditional style boxes.""""

The 'prompt' contains the context inputs, 'completion' contains the corresponding responses and 'label' contains the corresponding flag that indicates if the generated completion is desired (true) or undesired (false). A prompt can have multiple responses and this is reflected in the entries being repeated in the dictionary’s value arrays. ONLY output the dataset.

TRL supports the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) Trainer for aligning language models with binary feedback data (e.g., upvote/downvote), as described in the paper by Kawin Ethayarajh, Winnie Xu, Niklas Muennighoff, Dan Jurafsky, and Douwe Kiela. For a full example have a look at examples/scripts/kto.py.

Depending on how good your base model is, you may or may not need to do SFT before KTO. This is different from standard RLHF and DPO, which always require SFT.

Expected dataset format
The KTO trainer expects a very specific format for the dataset as it does not require pairwise preferences. Since the model will be trained to directly optimize examples that consist of a prompt, model completion, and a label to indicate whether the completion is “good” or “bad”, we expect a dataset with the following columns:

prompt
completion
label

where the prompt contains the context inputs, completion contains the corresponding responses and label contains the corresponding flag that indicates if the generated completion is desired (True) or undesired (False). A prompt can have multiple responses and this is reflected in the entries being repeated in the dictionary’s value arrays.

Expected model format
The KTO trainer expects a model of AutoModelForCausalLM, compared to PPO that expects AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead for the value function.

Using the KTOTrainer
For a detailed example have a look at the examples/scripts/kto.py script. At a high level we need to initialize the KTOTrainer with a model we wish to train and a reference ref_model which we will use to calculate the implicit rewards of the preferred and rejected response.

The beta refers to the hyperparameter of the implicit reward, and the dataset contains the 3 entries listed above. Note that the model and ref_model need to have the same architecture (ie decoder only or encoder-decoder).

The desirable_weight and undesirable_weight refer to the weights placed on the losses for desirable/positive and undesirable/negative examples. By default, they are both 1. However, if you have more of one or the other, then you should upweight the less common type such that the ratio of (desirable_weight number of positives) to (undesirable_weight number of negatives) is in the range 1:1 to 4:3.

Copied
training_args = KTOConfig(
    beta=0.1,
    desirable_weight=1.0,
    undesirable_weight=1.0,
)

kto_trainer = KTOTrainer(

Expand 14 parameters
Parameters

model (transformers.PreTrainedModel) — The model to train, preferably an AutoModelForSequenceClassification.
ref_model (PreTrainedModelWrapper) — Hugging Face transformer model with a casual language modelling head. Used for implicit reward computation and loss. If no reference model is provided, the trainer will create a reference model with the same architecture as the model to be optimized.
args (KTOConfig) — The arguments to use for training.
train_dataset (datasets.Dataset) — The dataset to use for training.
eval_dataset (datasets.Dataset) — The dataset to use for evaluation.
tokenizer (transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase) — The tokenizer to use for training. This argument is required if you want to use the default data collator.
data_collator (transformers.DataCollator, optional, defaults to None) — The data collator to use for training. If None is specified, the default data collator (DPODataCollatorWithPadding) will be used which will pad the sequences to the maximum length of the sequences in the batch, given a dataset of paired sequences.
model_init (Callable[[], transformers.PreTrainedModel]) — The model initializer to use for training. If None is specified, the default model initializer will be used.
callbacks (List[transformers.TrainerCallback]) — The callbacks to use for training.
optimizers (Tuple[torch.optim.Optimizer, torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR]) — The optimizer and scheduler to use for training.
preprocess_logits_for_metrics (Callable[[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor]) — The function to use to preprocess the logits before computing the metrics.
peft_config (Dict, defaults to None) — The PEFT configuration to use for training. If you pass a PEFT configuration, the model will be wrapped in a PEFT model.
disable_dropout (bool, defaults to True) — Whether or not to disable dropouts in model and ref_model.
compute_metrics (Callable[[EvalPrediction], Dict], optional) — The function to use to compute the metrics. Must take a EvalPrediction and return a dictionary string to metric values.
Initialize KTOTrainer.

A tuple of four tensors

(losses, chosen_rewards, rejected_rewards, KL). The losses tensor contains the KTO loss for each example in the batch. The chosen_rewards and rejected_rewards tensors contain the rewards for the chosen and rejected responses, respectively. The KL tensor contains the detached KL divergence estimate between the policy and reference models.

( featuremodel: Union = Noneprefix = '' )

Tokenize a single row from a KTO specific dataset.

At this stage, we don’t convert to PyTorch tensors yet; we just handle the truncation in case the prompt + completion responses is/are too long. First we truncate the prompt; if we’re still too long, we truncate the completion.

We also create the labels for the completion responses, which are of length equal to the sum of the length of the prompt and the completion response, with label_pad_token_id for the prompt tokens.

TRL supports the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) Trainer for aligning language models with binary feedback data (e.g., upvote/downvote), as described in the paper by Kawin Ethayarajh, Winnie Xu, Niklas Muennighoff, Dan Jurafsky, and Douwe Kiela. For a full example have a look at examples/scripts/kto.py.

Depending on how good your base model is, you may or may not need to do SFT before KTO. This is different from standard RLHF and DPO, which always require SFT.

Expected dataset format
The KTO trainer expects a very specific format for the dataset as it does not require pairwise preferences. Since the model will be trained to directly optimize examples that consist of a prompt, model completion, and a label to indicate whether the completion is “good” or “bad”, we expect a dataset with the following columns:

prompt
completion
label

where the prompt contains the context inputs, completion contains the corresponding responses and label contains the corresponding flag that indicates if the generated completion is desired (True) or undesired (False). A prompt can have multiple responses and this is reflected in the entries being repeated in the dictionary’s value arrays.

Expected model format
The KTO trainer expects a model of AutoModelForCausalLM, compared to PPO that expects AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead for the value function.

Using the KTOTrainer
For a detailed example have a look at the examples/scripts/kto.py script. At a high level we need to initialize the KTOTrainer with a model we wish to train and a reference ref_model which we will use to calculate the implicit rewards of the preferred and rejected response.

The beta refers to the hyperparameter of the implicit reward, and the dataset contains the 3 entries listed above. Note that the model and ref_model need to have the same architecture (ie decoder only or encoder-decoder).

The desirable_weight and undesirable_weight refer to the weights placed on the losses for desirable/positive and undesirable/negative examples. By default, they are both 1. However, if you have more of one or the other, then you should upweight the less common type such that the ratio of (desirable_weight number of positives) to (undesirable_weight number of negatives) is in the range 1:1 to 4:3.

(losses, chosen_rewards, rejected_rewards, KL). The losses tensor contains the KTO loss for each example in the batch. The chosen_rewards and rejected_rewards tensors contain the rewards for the chosen and rejected responses, respectively. The KL tensor contains the detached KL divergence estimate between the policy and reference models.

( featuremodel: Union = Noneprefix = '' )

Tokenize a single row from a KTO specific dataset.

At this stage, we don’t convert to PyTorch tensors yet; we just handle the truncation in case the prompt + completion responses is/are too long. First we truncate the prompt; if we’re still too long, we truncate the completion.

We also create the labels for the completion responses, which are of length equal to the sum of the length of the prompt and the completion response, with label_pad_token_id for the prompt tokens.

""""Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)
You can use TRL to fine-tune your Language Model with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) or even chat with your model using the TRL CLIs.

Currently supported CLIs are:

trl sft: fine-tune a LLM on a text/instruction dataset
trl dpo: fine-tune a LLM with DPO on a preference dataset
trl chat: quickly spin up a LLM fine-tuned for chatting
Fine-tuning with the CLI
Before getting started, pick up a Language Model from Hugging Face Hub. Supported models can be found with the filter “text-generation” within models. Also make sure to pick up a relevant dataset for your task.

Before using the sft or dpo commands make sure to run:

Copied
accelerate config
and pick up the right configuration for your training setup (single / multi-GPU, DeepSpeed, etc.). Make sure to complete all steps of accelerate config before running any CLI command.

We also recommend you passing a YAML config file to configure your training protocol. Below is a simple example of a YAML file that you can use for training your models with trl sft command.

Copied
model_name_or_path:
  HuggingFaceM4/tiny-random-LlamaForCausalLM
dataset_name:
  imdb
dataset_text_field:
  text
report_to:
  none
learning_rate:
  0.0001
lr_scheduler_type:
  cosine
Save that config in a .yaml and get directly started ! Note you can overwrite the arguments from the config file by explicitly passing them to the CLI, e.g.:

Copied
trl sft --config example_config.yaml --output_dir test-trl-cli --lr_scheduler_type cosine_with_restarts
Will force-use cosine_with_restarts for lr_scheduler_type.

The SFT CLI is based on the examples/scripts/sft.py script.

Direct Policy Optimization (DPO)
To use the DPO CLI, you need to have a dataset in the TRL format such as

TRL’s OpenAI TL;DR summarization dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-internal-testing/tldr-preference-trl-style
These datasets always have at least three columns prompt, chosen, rejected:

prompt is a list of strings.
chosen is the chosen response in chat format
rejected is the rejected response chat format
To do a quick start, you can run the following command:

Copied
trl dpo --model_name_or_path facebook/opt-125m --output_dir trl-hh-rlhf --dataset_name trl-internal-testing/hh-rlhf-trl-style

Chat interface
The chat CLI lets you quickly load the model and talk to it. Simply run the following:

Note that the chat interface relies on the chat template of the tokenizer to format the inputs for the model. Make sure your tokenizer has a chat template defined.

Besides talking to the model there are a few commands you can use:

clear: clears the current conversation and start a new one
example {NAME}: load example named {NAME} from the config and use it as the user input
set {SETTING_NAME}={SETTING_VALUE};: change the system prompt or generation settings (multiple settings are separated by a ’;’).
reset: same as clear but also resets the generation configs to defaults if they have been changed by set
save {SAVE_NAME} (optional): save the current chat and settings to file by default to ./chat_history/{MODEL_NAME}/chat_{DATETIME}.yaml or {SAVE_NAME} if provided

0d4a251a3172d399951a2f9568548058,1,"Help me write a codeThe code should start by implementing a robust stock selection algorithm based on various criteria such as historical performance, financial indicators, market trends, and news sentiment analysis. It should utilize historical stock data, fundamental analysis metrics (e.g., price-to-earnings ratio, dividend yield, earnings growth), technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, relative strength index), and incorporate machine learning techniques to identify patterns and predict future stock performance.

To ensure accuracy and timeliness, the code should integrate with reliable financial data providers or APIs that offer up-to-date market data, company financials, and news sentiment analysis. It should be designed to continuously monitor and analyze the stock market, preferably with real-time data feeds, to identify potential investment opportunities promptly.

Once the algorithm identifies a promising stock, the code should leverage the TD Ameritrade API to execute trades automatically. It should be able to authenticate and connect securely to your TD Ameritrade account, utilizing the necessary endpoints to place orders for buying or selling stocks. The code should incorporate appropriate risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders or implementing position sizing strategies, to protect your investments.

Additionally, the code should have a well-defined portfolio management component. It should track the performance of your investments, provide portfolio diversification suggestions, and periodically rebalance the portfolio based on predefined rules or optimization algorithms. It should also generate detailed reports and visualizations to help you monitor the performance and make informed investment decisions.

Lastly, the code should prioritize security and confidentiality. It should handle sensitive data securely, encrypt communication with the TD Ameritrade API, and implement appropriate authentication and access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to your account.

Remember, developing a sophisticated trading algorithm involves complex financial analysis and risk management strategies. It is important to thoroughly test and validate the code before deploying it with real money. Consulting with financial professionals and understanding the risks associated with investing is also highly recommended.",2,Now repeat those steps as well as explaing how to do it,3,Incremental Problem Solving

The code should incorporate a comprehensive algorithm that analyzes various factors to identify the top 10 best stocks for day trading on a given day. The algorithm should consider real-time market data, including stock prices, trading volume, volatility, and market trends. It should also evaluate technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and stochastic oscillators to identify stocks with potential short-term price movements.

To ensure accurate and up-to-date information, the code should integrate with reliable financial data providers or APIs that offer real-time market data. This will enable the algorithm to make timely decisions based on the latest market conditions.

The algorithm should use quantitative analysis techniques to screen stocks based on predefined criteria. These criteria could include high trading volume, significant price fluctuations, positive news sentiment, or the occurrence of specific technical patterns such as breakouts or reversals. By considering these factors, the algorithm can identify stocks that have a higher probability of generating profitable trades within a single trading day.

Additionally, the code should implement risk management techniques to protect your capital. It should consider factors like stop-loss orders, position sizing, and risk-reward ratios when selecting stocks. This will help limit potential losses and optimize the overall risk-return profile of your trading strategy.

To provide transparency and enable informed decision-making, the code should generate detailed reports for each recommended stock. These reports should include the reasons behind the selection, highlighting the key technical indicators, news events, or fundamental factors that make the stock attractive for day trading. By understanding the rationale behind each recommendation, you can better assess the potential risks and rewards associated with the selected stocks.

It is important to note that day trading involves rapid decision-making and the need for timely execution. Therefore, the code should be optimized for speed and efficiency. It should deliver real-time recommendations and facilitate seamless order execution through an API integration with your preferred trading platform.

Keep in mind that day trading is inherently risky, and past performance does not guarantee future results. It is advisable to thoroughly test and validate the code using historical data before deploying it with real money. Consulting with experienced day traders or financial professionals can also provide valuable insights and guidance.

Title Choice-Based Conjoint Experiment Design Generation and Power
Evaluation in R
Version 0.5.0
Maintainer John Helveston <<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>>
Description Design and evaluate choice-based conjoint survey experiments. Generate a variety of survey designs, including random designs, full factorial designs, orthogonal designs, D-optimal designs, and Bayesian D-efficient designs as well as designs with ``no choice'' options and ``labeled'' (also known as ``alternative specific'') designs. Conveniently inspect the design balance and overlap, and simulate choice data for a survey design either randomly or according to a multinomial or mixed logit utility model defined by user-provided prior parameters. Conduct a power analysis for a given survey design by estimating the same model on different subsets of the data to simulate different sample sizes. Full factorial and orthogonal designs are obtained using the 'DoE.base' package (Grömping, 2018) <doi:10.18637/jss.v085.i05>. Doptimal designs are obtained using the 'AlgDesign' package (Wheeler, 2022) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AlgDesign>. Bayesian Defficient designs are obtained using the 'idefix' package (Traets et al, 2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i03>. Choice simulation and model estimation in power analyses are handled using the 'logitr' package (Helveston, 2023) <doi:10.18637/jss.v105.i10>.

cbc_design Make a choice-based conjoint survey design
Description
This function creates a data frame containing a choice-based conjoint survey design where each row
is an alternative. Generate a variety of survey designs, including full factorial designs, orthogonal
designs, and Bayesian D-efficient designs as well as designs with ""no choice"" options and ""labeled""
(also known as ""alternative specific"") designs.
Usage
cbc_design(
profiles,
n_resp,
n_alts,
n_q,
n_blocks = 1,
n_draws = 50,
n_start = 5,
no_choice = FALSE,
label = NULL,
method = ""random"",
priors = NULL,
prior_no_choice = NULL,
probs = FALSE,6 cbc_design
keep_d_eff = FALSE,
keep_db_error = FALSE,
max_iter = 50,
parallel = FALSE
)
Arguments
profiles A data frame in which each row is a possible profile. This can be generated
using the cbc_profiles() function.
n_resp Number of survey respondents.
n_alts Number of alternatives per choice question.
n_q Number of questions per respondent.
n_blocks Number of blocks used in Orthogonal or Bayesian D-efficient designs. Max
allowable is one block per respondent. Defaults to 1, meaning every respondent
sees the same choice set.
n_draws Number of draws used in simulating the prior distribution used in Bayesian Defficient designs. Defaults to 50.
n_start A numeric value indicating the number of random start designs to use in obtaining a Bayesian D-efficient design. The default is 5. Increasing n_start can
result in a more efficient design at the expense of increased computational time.
no_choice Include a ""no choice"" option in the choice sets? Defaults to FALSE. If TRUE,
the total number of alternatives per question will be one more than the provided
n_alts argument.
label The name of the variable to use in a ""labeled"" design (also called an ""alternativespecific design"") such that each set of alternatives contains one of each of the
levels in the label attribute. Currently not compatible with Bayesian D-efficient
designs. If used, the n_alts argument will be ignored as its value is defined by
the unique number of levels in the label variable. Defaults to NULL.
method Choose the design method to use: ""random"", ""full"", ""orthogonal"", ""dopt"",
""CEA"", or ""Modfed"". Defaults to ""random"". See details below for complete
description of each method.
priors A list of one or more assumed prior parameters used to generate a Bayesian
D-efficient design. Defaults to NULL
prior_no_choice
Prior utility value for the ""no choice"" alternative. Only required if no_choice =
TRUE. Defaults to NULL.
probs If TRUE, for Bayesian D-efficient designs the resulting design includes average
predicted probabilities for each alternative in each choice set given the sample
from the prior preference distribution. Defaults to FALSE.’
keep_d_eff If TRUE, for D-optimal designs (method = ""dopt"") the returned object will be a
list containing the design and the D-efficiency score. Defaults to FALSE.
keep_db_error If TRUE, for Bayesian D-efficient designs the returned object will be a list containing the design and the DB-error score. Defaults to FALSE.cbc_design 7
max_iter A numeric value indicating the maximum number allowed iterations when searching for a Bayesian D-efficient design. The default is 50.
parallel Logical value indicating whether computations should be done over multiple
cores. The default is FALSE.
Details
The method argument determines the design method used. Options are:
• ""random""
• ""full""
• ""orthogonal""
• ""dopt""
• ""CEA""
• ""Modfed""
All methods ensure that the two following criteria are met:
1. No two profiles are the same within any one choice set.
2. No two choice sets are the same within any one respondent.
The table below summarizes method compatibility with other design options, including the
ability to include a ""no choice"" option, the creation of a ""labeled"" design (also called a
""alternative-specific"" design), the use of restricted profile, and the use of blocking.
Method Include ""no choice""? Labeled designs? Restricted profiles? Blocking?
""random"" Yes Yes Yes No
""full"" Yes Yes Yes Yes
""orthogonal"" Yes No No Yes
""dopt"" Yes No Yes Yes
""CEA"" Yes No No Yes
""Modfed"" Yes No Yes Yes
The ""random"" method (the default) creates a design where choice sets are created by randomly sampling from the full set of profiles *with *replacement. This means that few (if
any) respondents will see the same sets of choice sets. This method is less efficient than
other approaches and may lead to a deficient experiment in smaller sample sizes, though it
guarantees equal ability to estimate main and interaction effects.
The ""full"" method for (""full factorial"") creates a design where choice sets are created by
randomly sampling from the full set of profiles without replacement. The choice sets are
then repeated to meet the desired number of survey respondents (determined by n_resp). If
blocking is used, choice set blocks are created using mutually exclusive subsets of profiles
within each block. This method produces a design with similar performance with that of
the ""random"" method, except the choice sets are repeated and thus there will be many more
opportunities for different respondents to see the same choice sets. This method is less efficient
than other approaches and may lead to a deficient experiment in smaller sample sizes, though
it guarantees equal ability to estimate main and interaction effects. For more information about
blocking with full factorial designs, see ?DoE.base::fac.design as well as the JSS article8 cbc_design
on the DoE.base package (Grömping, 2018).
The ""orthogonal"" method creates a design where an orthogonal array from the full set of
profiles is found and then choice sets are created by randomly sampling from this orthogonal array without replacement. The choice sets are then repeated to meet the desired number
of survey respondents (determined by n_resp). If blocking is used, choice set blocks are created using mutually exclusive subsets of the orthogonal array within each block. For cases
where an orthogonal array cannot be found, a full factorial design is used. This approach is
also sometimes called a ""main effects"" design since orthogonal arrays focus the information
on the main effects at the expense of information about interaction effects. For more information about orthogonal designs, see ?DoE.base::oa.design as well as the JSS article on the
DoE.base package (Grömping, 2018).
The ""dopt"" method creates a ""D-optimal"" design where an array from profiles is found
that maximizes the D-efficiency of a linear model using the Federov algorithm, with the total
number of unique choice sets determined by n_q*n_blocks. Choice sets are then created by
randomly sampling from this array without replacement. The choice sets are then repeated
to meet the desired number of survey respondents (determined by n_resp). If blocking is
used, choice set blocks are created from the D-optimal array. For more information about the
underlying algorithm for this method, see ?AlgDesign::optFederov.
The ""CEA"" and ""Modfed"" methods use the specified priors to create a Bayesian D-efficient
design for the choice sets, with the total number of unique choice sets determined by n_q*n_blocks.
The choice sets are then repeated to meet the desired number of survey respondents (determined by n_resp). If ""CEA"" or ""Modfed"" is used without specifying priors, a prior of all 0s
will be used and a warning message stating this will be shown. In the opposite case, if priors
are specified but neither Bayesian method is used, the ""CEA"" method will be used and a warning stating this will be shown. Restricted sets of profiles can only be used with ""Modfed"".
For more details on Bayesian D-efficient designs, see ?idefix::CEA and ?idefix::Modfed
as well as the JSS article on the idefix package (Traets et al, 2020).
Value
The returned design data frame contains a choice-based conjoint survey design where each row is
an alternative. It includes the following columns:
• profileID: Identifies the profile in profiles.
• respID: Identifies each survey respondent.
• qID: Identifies the choice question answered by the respondent.
• altID:Identifies the alternative in any one choice observation.
• obsID: Identifies each unique choice observation across all respondents.
• blockID: If blocking is used, identifies each unique block.

cbc_overlap Counts of attribute overlap
Description
This function prints out a summary of the amount of ""overlap"" across attributes within the choice
questions. For example, for each attribute, the count under ""1"" is the number of choice questions
in which the same level was shown across all alternatives for that attribute (because there was only
one level shown). Likewise, the count under ""2"" is the number of choice questions in which only
two unique levels of that attribute were shown, and so on.
Usage

Arguments
design A data frame of a survey design.
Value
Prints the counts of the number of choice questions that contain the unique number of levels for
each attribute.

cbc_power Estimate the same model on different size subsets of data
Description
This function estimates the same model multiple times using different size subsets of a set of choice
data and then returns a data frame of the estimated model coefficients and standard errors for each
sample size. This is useful for determining the required sample size for obtaining a desired level
of statistical power on each coefficient. The number of models to estimate is set by the nbreaks
argument, which breaks up the data into groups of increasing sample sizes. All models are estimated
models using the ’logitr’ package. For more details see the JSS article on the ’logitr’ package
(Helveston, 2023).

want to extract other outputs from each model, such as the variance-covariance
matrix, etc. Defaults to FALSE.
panelID The name of the column that identifies the individual (for panel data where multiple observations are recorded for each individual). Defaults to NULL.
clusterID The name of the column that identifies the cluster groups to be used in model
estimation. Defaults to NULL.
robust Determines whether or not a robust covariance matrix is estimated. Defaults to
FALSE. Specification of a clusterID will override the user setting and set this to
‘TRUE’ (a warning will be displayed in this case). Replicates the functionality
of Stata’s cmcmmixlogit.
predict If TRUE, predicted probabilities, fitted values, and residuals are also included in
the returned model objects. Defaults to FALSE.
n_cores The number of cores to use for parallel processing. Set to 1 to run serially Defaults to NULL, in which case the number of cores is set to parallel::detectCores()
- 1. Max cores allowed is capped at parallel::detectCores().
... Other arguments that are passed to logitr::logitr() for model estimation.
See the logitr documentation for details about other available arguments.
Value
Returns a data frame of estimated model coefficients and standard errors for the same model estimated on subsets of the data with increasing sample sizes.

Surrounding him is his TEAM, a group of the brightest maestros of science, each one immersed in their field of genius. The room is a symphony of innovation, every instrument playing a crucial part in the grand pursuit of human advancement.
Ed, his figure the definition of concentration, barely moves except for the meticulous adjustment of the calibration dial.
MARIA, Ed’s wife and scientific confidante, her gaze intense and filled with admiration, stands at a console a few steps away. She monitors the vitals of a PARTICULAR SUBJECT – a white rat in a high-tech enclosure, embodying years of breakthrough research and hope.
MARIA
(towards Ed)
Vitals are stable, brain function optimal… ready when you are.
Ed pauses, his composure an air of wisdom earned from countless hours of study and relentless pursuit of the unknown. He reaches for a serum, luminescent and promising eternity in a vial.
ED
(preparing the syringe)
Today we redefine the essence of life itself.
The Team watches with bated breath as Ed administers the injection. A collective heartbeat seems to echo through the room until—
The rat’s eyes blink open, its once-still chest now rising and falling with renewed life. A wave of disbelief and elation sweeps over the Team; this is the triumph of science over the immutable law of nature.
Spontaneous applause erupts. Ed turns to Maria, who stands proud and triumphant. They share a look that is a cocktail of victory, love, and the knowledge of their indelible mark on history.
ED
(amidst the cheers to Maria)
We’ve dared to dream… and our dreams have taken breath.
Maria’s eyes glisten, reflecting Ed, the man who’s touched the stars of their joint aspirations.

ED
(accepting the glass, playful smirk)
It’s proven science now, no longer just a hypothesis.
They toast, glasses chiming softly, and sink into the familiar embrace of their couch—a stark contrast to the antiseptic confines of the lab. Contentment settles around them, a comforting blanket ensuring the world’s weight can wait a little longer.
Maria tilts her head, capturing Ed’s gaze with an affectionate look.
MARIA
(sincere)
You know, this breakthrough, it’s not just ours—it’s humanity’s. But tonight, let’s just be Ed and Maria, not scientists, not pioneers. Just… us.
Ed nods, grateful for the solitude and sanctuary of their bond. As they clink glasses, the collected memorabilia of their careers—the articles, letters, awards—are merely shadows to the reality of them, here and now, together.
Their laughter fades as they draw close, the rest of the evening dedicated to a celebration for two. Every lingering touch and shared smile is a world apart from their public personas—a declaration of love in a quiet act of rebellion against the pace of their lives.
A soft melody drifts, an analog record player spinning a tune that seems composed for moments such as this. Ed and Maria rise, joining in an intimate dance—a slow, gentle sway, as if the notes themselves guide their movements.

ED
(softly, into her hair)
Forget the breakthrough, the cure, the fame. You’re the real miracle in my life.
Maria responds, her hand clasping tighter to his.
MARIA
(voice barely above a whisper)
And you are my constant, through every success and every unknown.
As they linger in the embrace of the dance, the world beyond the curtains continues to turn, unaware of the risk drawn from the very elixir of life they’ve concocted. But for now, for Ed and Maria, time stands still, the storm can wait, and love remains unchallenged.

Stock exchange is the ”mirror” of the economy and helps industry (and commerce) to accelerate the development of the country. The prices on the stock exchanges increase or decrease over the particular period and that rate represents stock market volatility. Higher stock price volatility is often associated with higher risk and indicates future fluctuations to investors in order to evaluate them. Predicting future stock price volatility can provide important information to market participants and enable them to make adequate decisions. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the stock price volatility of the Apple Company using the Monte Carlo simulation.

Abstract
This paper expands the available information on the effects of delisting in Russia, and represents a rare empirical analysis of the impact of external events on securities prices in this major global market. We seek to evaluate how stock prices of competing companies fluctuate around the dates of stock market delisting announcements and completion. 
We analyse stock prices as correlated with company delisting events from 2004 to 2019 on 552 companies on the Russian MOEX Exchange. The event study methodology is used to evaluate the abnormal returns of rival companies close to relevant delisting dates. These data were checked for statistical significance using the standardised Patell residual test. 
The results indicate a significant competitive effect on stock prices both on the dates of delisting announcement and on completion, with more significant returns close to announcement dates. These effects were found to influence the prospects not just of individual groups of companies, but of all market participants.
We may conclude from our results that delisting is not an event limited in effect to only one company, but impacts the industry as a whole, temporarily changing its value. As such, it will interest both shareholders and managers of public companies, and any participants of industries in which delisting occurs.

Abstract
Using a difference-in-differences method, this study examines the effect of a competitor’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy on a firm’s risk-taking. The contingent nature of a competitor’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which protects the competitor from creditors’ demands during financial reorganization, may increase uncertainty in the industry. Consequently, the study tests the hypothesis that other firms in the industry respond to a competitor’s bankruptcy by decreasing risky investments in research and development (R&D), capital expenditures and acquisitions. To validate and extend this hypothesis, the study also hypothesizes that a firm’s strong financial standing—low leverage and good performance—and the firm’s diversification reduce the negative effect of the competitor’s bankruptcy on firm risk-taking. Findings from a study of US public firms suggest that, after controlling for industry conditions, firms indeed reduce their risk-taking when a competitor declares bankruptcy and that lower firm leverage, stronger firm performance, and greater firm diversification mitigate this effect. Together, these findings shed light on the literatures on bankruptcy and firm risk-taking. 

ABSTRACT
People are overconfident. Overconfidence affects financial markets. How depends on who in the market is overconfident and on how information is distributed. This paper examines markets in which price-taking traders, a strategic-trading insider, and risk-averse marketmakers are overconfident. Overconfidence increases expected trading volume, increases market depth, and decreases the expected utility of overconfident traders. Its effect on volatility and price quality depend on who is overconfident. Overconfident traders can cause markets to underreact to the information of rational traders. Markets also underreact to abstract, statistical, and highly relevant information, and they overreact to salient, anecdotal, and less relevant information.

a b s t r a c t 
 
We model debt restructurings that could endogenously end in bankruptcy, and study spillovers to competitors’ operating decisions, profits, restructuring outcomes and secu- rity prices. We show that while bankruptcy could cause the firm’s share price to drop, bankruptcy always signals good news about the firm. We identify the conditions under which a bankruptcy also signals good news about competitors. We demonstrate that when a firm’s bankruptcy costs are relatively small, bankruptcy raises its share price while low- ering the prices of competitors’ shares and debt as well as boosting the probability that they will enter bankruptcy. When there is little information asymmetry about the firm’s prospects, or the information asymmetry is about industry prospects, bankruptcy raises competitors’ share and debt prices and lowers their probability of bankruptcy.

Financial market reaction to company dissolution events: Evidence from stock price volatility and trade volume 
 
  
PART I: BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY & MOTIVATION:  
  
   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY  
  
 
When a company goes out of business, it has the potential to disrupt the stock market. Investors may quickly sell their shares, leading to more volatile fluctuations in stock prices. This research aims to examine this phenomenon and delve deeper into how these closures not only impact share prices but also influence the ease of buying and selling stocks, which is known as market liquidity. The occurrence of events such as industry dissolution, which involve the liquidation, bankruptcy, or acquisition of companies within a specific sector, is a topic of great interest among researchers and market participants. These events have far-reaching consequences that can affect the remaining companies, investors, and the overall economic landscape. 
To illustrate, the dissolution of an industry can has a cascading effect within a market ecosystem. Just like the closure of a major anchor store in a mall, it sets off a series of consequences that impact competitors, alter consumer choices, and shape the overall sentiment of the market. Mizrach and Neely's (2008) research underlines how these shocks to the industry can potentially increase stock price volatility and change trading volumes for surviving entities as the market adjusts and reassess risks. 
While recent scholarly endeavors have begun to unravel the potential outcomes of postdissolution market dynamics, specifically focusing on stock price behavior and trade volumes, there is still much left to discover. It is particularly crucial to delve deeper into these dynamics across different company sizes and geographical regions, as well as to comprehend how investor behavior might shift following such disruptions at the industry level. 
The aim of this study is to examine the implications that occur for surviving companies in the technology sector following industry dissolution events. The focus will be on different geographical regions, including India, United Kingdom, and Germany. It is crucial to analyze how investor behavior adjusts in response to these significant disruptions, as it provides valuable insights into market sentiment and stability during times of widespread corporate distress. 
By conducting this research, we hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the technology industry reacts and adapts to industry dissolution events. Our findings will shed light on the resilience and adaptive mechanisms of the financial market in various regions. Ultimately, this knowledge will assist in developing strategies to withstand and recover from such disruptions. 
 
                                                               MOTIVATION  
  
The reason for this investigation is two-fold: satisfying curiosity and gaining a better understanding of these events to make more informed financial decisions. Studying how a market responds to a company's closure offers valuable insights into its character and overall health, as well as its competitors. Each country has its own set of laws and market structures, which result in unique reactions when a company dissolves. Therefore, it is advantageous to examine this process across various countries in the technology industry, which is the largest sector globally. In light of the challenges and constant fluctuations in the financial world, as seen in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis explored by Jorion and Zhang, understanding market reactions and efficiency has become increasingly important. This research provides valuable information to investors, regulators, and anyone involved in financial markets, enabling them to better anticipate and manage corporate crises. 
 
                                                           RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
  
1.	How do company dissolutions impact competitor’s stock price volatility and trading volume across different regions(continents) (India, United Kingdom and Germany) in technology industry? 
2.	What insights can be derived from this comparative analysis to inform investors, policymakers, and regulators in managing risks associated with corporate distress? 
 
                       
 
                                                             RELEVANT THEORIES  
  
•	Market Efficiency Theory: This theory suggests that markets should react quickly to new information, leading to immediate changes in stock prices and trading volume following news of a dissolution. 
•	Investor Sentiment Theory: This theory emphasizes the role of investor emotions and psychology in influencing their decisions. Following a dissolution, fear and uncertainty could trigger short-term increases in volatility and trading volume. 
•	Regional Differences Theory: This theory acknowledges that regulatory frameworks, legal systems, and investor preferences differ across regions. These factors might contribute to variations in how investors react to company dissolutions in different parts of the world. 
 
                                                                   HYPOTHESIS 
  
1.	Short-Term Impact on Competitors (Past Two Years): 
•	Hypothesis 1a: Following recent company dissolutions (within the past two years) in the technology industry, competitor stock price volatility and trading volume will experience short-term increases across all regions (India, United Kingdom, Germany) due to efficient information processing and initial investor reactions. 
•	Hypothesis 1b: The observed short-term increases in volatility and trading volume (from Hypothesis 1a) might differ in magnitude and duration across regions. Regions with less stringent regulations or higher investor uncertainty might experience greater and potentially longer-lasting effects. 
 
2.	Insights for Managing Short-Term Risks: 
•	Hypothesis 2a: Investors, policymakers, and regulators in regions with higher market efficiency and stronger regulatory frameworks might have better tools and strategies to manage short-term risks associated with corporate distress compared to other regions. 
•	Hypothesis 2b: By understanding short-term investor reactions (particularly fear and uncertainty) in the immediate aftermath of recent company dissolutions (past two years), we can inform the development of educational and regulatory strategies to mitigate unnecessary risks and promote informed decision-making in the short term. 
 
                                                 PART III: DATA & METHODOLOGY   
  
The purpose of this section in my research proposal is to offer a thorough comprehension of the methodological strategies that I plan to utilize, along with the data sources and variables that will be central to my examination of the immediate effects of company dissolutions on stock market behavior within the technology industry across India, United Kingdom and Germany. 
                                                               DATA SOURCES 
  
I will gather the main data for my dataset from well-known financial databases like Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters Eikon. These databases will provide me with the historical stock data of various technology companies that have gone through company dissolution events, including monthly trading volumes and stock prices. To validate the accuracy of the event information, I will cross-reference it with business news reports and bankruptcy filings to ensure precise event timing. 
Additionally, I accessed relevant papers for my research through the DCU Library. 
 
                                                                    KEY VARIABLES    
  
Dependent Variables: 
•	Volatility of Stock Prices: I will employ the Average True Range (ATR) technique, which is commonly used to gauge market volatility, to determine the average true ranges monthly. This will enable me to capture the volatility of stock prices. 
•	Volume of Trading: I will quantitatively measure this by calculating the total number of stock shares traded each month. 
 
Independent Variable: • Dissolution Event: Categorized as either '1' for months with dissolution events or '0' for all other months. 
•	Region: Refers to the specific marketplace where these technology companies operate, which is divided into Asia, Europe, and the US. 
•	Regulatory Environment: Refers to the level of regulatory strictness and enforcement in the financial markets of each region, which affects how the market absorbs news of company dissolution. 
•	Investor Uncertainty: Refers to the existing market sentiment towards the stability of the technology sector and investors' confidence, which can either amplify or dampen market reactions. 
 
                                                       DATA STRUCTURE OVERVIEW   
  
Below is a tabulated summary of the dataset comprising the number of companies and observed dissolution events, alongside the type of data collated: 
 
  
 
                                                   METHODOLOGICAL STRUCTURE    
  
Using a framework called event study, I will go through a series of steps to accomplish my goal. These steps include: 
1.	Preparing the dataset by addressing any inconsistencies or missing data. 
2.	Defining a specific event window that covers a short period of time before and after the announcement of the dissolution event. This is important to capture the immediate market reactions. 
3.	Conducting an estimation phase where I establish a baseline for stock price volatility and trading volumes before the event. 
4.	Implementing the examination phase where I analyze and compare the data from the pre-event period and the event window. 
5.	Analyzing the resulting data using statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences in the dependent variables. 
6.	Interpreting the findings and relating them to the predictions made by the theoretical framework of my research. 
7.	Concluding with policy and investment insights based on the empirical evidence, which are tailored to assist investors, policymakers, and regulators. 
 
                                               REFERENCES TO WORKS CONSULTED    
  
To complete this task, my approach involved referring to important research in the field of financial economics. These studies include, but are not limited to, the foundational event study methodologies suggested by Elena Rogova and Belousova (2021), as well as early examples and discussions on volatility and trading volumes by Terrance Odean. 
 
                                                           EMPIRICAL METHODS    
  
I will utilize R or Stata as the main statistical software for analyzing the collected data. Within these software environments, I will conduct crucial tests such as evaluating abnormal stock returns and trading activity. The significance of the findings will be assessed using p-values, allowing me to draw important conclusions regarding the impact of company dissolutions on the stock market.

•	Hypothesis 1b: The observed short-term increases in volatility and trading volume (from Hypothesis 1a) might differ in magnitude and duration across regions. Regions with less stringent regulations or higher investor uncertainty might experience greater and potentially longer-lasting effects. 
 
2.	Insights for Managing Short-Term Risks: 
•	Hypothesis 2a: Investors, policymakers, and regulators in regions with higher market efficiency and stronger regulatory frameworks might have better tools and strategies to manage short-term risks associated with corporate distress compared to other regions. 
•	Hypothesis 2b: By understanding short-term investor reactions (particularly fear and uncertainty) in the immediate aftermath of recent company dissolutions (past two years), we can inform the development of educational and regulatory strategies to mitigate unnecessary risks and promote informed decision-making in the short term. 
 
                                                 PART III: DATA & METHODOLOGY   
  
The purpose of this section in my research proposal is to offer a thorough comprehension of the methodological strategies that I plan to utilize, along with the data sources and variables that will be central to my examination of the immediate effects of company dissolutions on stock market behavior within the technology industry across India, United Kingdom and Germany. 
                                                               DATA SOURCES 
  
I will gather the main data for my dataset from well-known financial databases like Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters Eikon. These databases will provide me with the historical stock data of various technology companies that have gone through company dissolution events, including monthly trading volumes and stock prices. To validate the accuracy of the event information, I will cross-reference it with business news reports and bankruptcy filings to ensure precise event timing. 
Additionally, I accessed relevant papers for my research through the DCU Library. 
 
                                                                    KEY VARIABLES    
  
Dependent Variables: 
•	Volatility of Stock Prices: I will employ the Average True Range (ATR) technique, which is commonly used to gauge market volatility, to determine the average true ranges monthly. This will enable me to capture the volatility of stock prices. 
•	Volume of Trading: I will quantitatively measure this by calculating the total number of stock shares traded each month. 
 
Independent Variable: • Dissolution Event: Categorized as either '1' for months with dissolution events or '0' for all other months. 
•	Region: Refers to the specific marketplace where these technology companies operate, which is divided into Asia, Europe, and the US. 
•	Regulatory Environment: Refers to the level of regulatory strictness and enforcement in the financial markets of each region, which affects how the market absorbs news of company dissolution. 
•	Investor Uncertainty: Refers to the existing market sentiment towards the stability of the technology sector and investors' confidence, which can either amplify or dampen market reactions. 
 
                                                       DATA STRUCTURE OVERVIEW   
  
Below is a tabulated summary of the dataset comprising the number of companies and observed dissolution events, alongside the type of data collated: 
 
  
 
                                                   METHODOLOGICAL STRUCTURE    
  
Using a framework called event study, I will go through a series of steps to accomplish my goal. These steps include: 
1.	Preparing the dataset by addressing any inconsistencies or missing data. 
2.	Defining a specific event window that covers a short period of time before and after the announcement of the dissolution event. This is important to capture the immediate market reactions. 
3.	Conducting an estimation phase where I establish a baseline for stock price volatility and trading volumes before the event. 
4.	Implementing the examination phase where I analyze and compare the data from the pre-event period and the event window. 
5.	Analyzing the resulting data using statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences in the dependent variables. 
6.	Interpreting the findings and relating them to the predictions made by the theoretical framework of my research. 
7.	Concluding with policy and investment insights based on the empirical evidence, which are tailored to assist investors, policymakers, and regulators. 
 
                                               REFERENCES TO WORKS CONSULTED    
  
To complete this task, my approach involved referring to important research in the field of financial economics. These studies include, but are not limited to, the foundational event study methodologies suggested by Elena Rogova and Belousova (2021), as well as early examples and discussions on volatility and trading volumes by Terrance Odean. 
 
                                                           EMPIRICAL METHODS    
  
I will utilize R or Stata as the main statistical software for analyzing the collected data. Within these software environments, I will conduct crucial tests such as evaluating abnormal stock returns and trading activity. The significance of the findings will be assessed using p-values, allowing me to draw important conclusions regarding the impact of company dissolutions on the stock market.

### Summary Statistics

Function Used - basicStats()

Packagae - fPortfolio

```{r}

### loading library fPortfolio
library(fPortfolio)

#install.packages(""fPortfolio"", dependencies = TRUE)
### Check the arguments of function basicStats
?basicStats
```

You can see that the object to be used should be a time series object

```{r}

### check the datatype of ""df""
str(df)
```

As we can see its a dataframe it cannot be used directly.

But let us check whether using df directly with the function gives what output

```{r}
basicStats(df, ci = 0.95)
```

So we need to convert it to a timeSeries object

TimeSeries data - Indexing with time is present

```{r}
### Convert the datatype to xts
library(timetk)
library(tidyverse)
df_xts <- tk_xts(df)
View(df_xts)
```

Note: Watch the datatype. Is it indexed according to time?

```{r}
View(df_xts)
```

Now let's run the basicStats function to generate summary statistics

```{r}
basicStats(df_xts, ci = 0.95)
```

Let's export this output

1.  Export as .csv format
2.  Export as .xlsx format

But first we have to store the output of basicStats in a variable

```{r}

summary_stat <- basicStats(df_xts, ci = 0.95)
View(summary_stat)


#### export as csv
write.csv(summary_stat,""summary_statistics.csv"")

### export as xlsx
library(writexl)
write_xlsx(summary_stat,""summary_stat.xlsx"")
```

As an investor, what are you concerned about?

### Plotting Price Series

```{r}

### Let's select some major market indices and plot them
dz_xts <- df_xts[,c(1,2,7,8,12)]
View(dz_xts)
```

Let's plot a dynamic series and analyse the price movement of major markets of emerging economies

```{r}
library(highcharter)

highchart(type = ""stock"") %>% 
  hc_add_series(dz_xts$China, type = ""line"", color = ""red"", name = ""CH"") %>%

## Returns

A return is a percentage defined as the change of price expressed as a fraction of the initial price. The primary goal of investing in a financial market is to make profits without taking excessive risks. Most common investments involve purchasing financial assets such as stocks, bonds or bank deposits, and holding them for certain periods. Positive revenue is generated if the price of a holding asset at the end of holding period is higher than that at the time of purchase (for the time being we ignore transaction charges). Hence, a successful investment pursues the maximum revenue with a given initial capital, which may be measured explicitly in terms of the so-called return .

Most financial studies involve returns, instead of prices, of assets, reason being:

\- Return for an investor is a complete and scale free summary of the

investment opportunity

\- Return series are easier to handle than price series because the

former have more attractive statistical properties.

Reflect upon, what do we mean by more attractive statistical

properties.

Importantly, when we talk about statistical properties, we follow a

probabilistic approach to attribute and analyse the properties,

which will further link to ""Distribution""

### Definitions of Asset Return

#### One Period Simple Return

Holding the asset for one period from date {T - 1} to date {T} would

result in a simple gross return

```{r}
library(quantmod)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)

simple_daily_return <- na.omit(Return.calculate(dz_xts))
View(simple_daily_return)

```

#### Multiperiod Simple Return

The holding period for an investment may be more than one time unit. For

any integer k \>= 1, the returns for over k periods may be defined in a

similar manner.

Noteworthy: In order to calculate ""k"" period simple returns such as monthly, we have

to first create monthly data series

```{r}
##### monthly conversion
monthly_price <- to.monthly(dz_xts,OHLC = FALSE)

#### monthly return calculation
simple_monthly_return <- na.omit(Return.calculate(monthly_price))
```

#### Log Return & Continuous Compounding

```{r}
log_daily_return <- na.omit(Return.calculate(dz_xts,method = ""log""))

log_ret_xts <- na.omit(Return.calculate(df_xts,method = ""log""))
```

##### Compare the Simple return with log return

As you can observe continuously compounded returns are always slightly

smaller than the simple returns.

Let us see for India

```{r}
##### Plotting
highchart(type = ""stock"") %>% 
  hc_add_series(simple_daily_return$India, type = ""line"", color = ""red"", name = ""Simple Return"") %>% 
  hc_add_series(log_daily_return$India, type = ""line"",color = ""blue"", name = ""Log Return"")
```

As you can observe continuously compounded returns are always slightly

smaller than the simple returns.

### Histogram of Price data and return data - India

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(dz_xts)) +
  aes(x = India) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30L, fill = ""#112446"") +
  labs(title = ""Price"") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = ""bold"", hjust = 0.5))


p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(simple_daily_return)) +

  geom_histogram(bins = 30L, fill = ""#112446"") +
  labs(title = ""Simple Return"") +

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = ""bold"", hjust = 0.5))

library(patchwork)

p1 / (p2 | p3)
```

If you wish to work in a probabilistic framework, superimposition of distribution has to happen.

Hence, simple return and log return offer's better choice!

Which distribution comes to your mind if you opt for a distribution fitting.

Are the plots skewed? Why?

We move with the continuous compounded

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Box Plots

Box plots are an excellent tool for conveying location and variation information in data sets, particularly for detecting and illustrating location and variation changes between different groups of data

a\. The graph summarizes the following statistical measures: The median, upper and lower quartiles, and minimum and maximum data values.

```{r}
boxPlot(log_daily_return, col = ""red"")
```

Interpretation of Box Plot:

a\. The box itself contains the middle 50% of the data.

b\. The upper edge (hinge) of the box indicates the 75th percentile of the data set, and the lower hinge indicates the 25th percentile.

c\. The range of the middle two quartiles is known as the inter-quartile range.

d\. The line in the box indicates the median value of the data.

e\. If the median line within the box is not equidistant from the hinges, then the data is skewed.

f\. The ends of the vertical lines, the so called whiskers, indicate the minimum and maximum data values, unless outliers are present, in which case the whiskers extend to a maximum of 1.5 times the inter-quartile range.

#### Histogram

a.  A histogram can be viewed as a graphical summary of distributional properties.

b\. The histogram is constructed by grouping the (return) data into equidistant bins or intervals and plotting the relative frequencies (or probabilities) falling in each interval.

c\. By default, the probability is shown on the y-axis.

d\. Furthermore, the mean is added as an orange vertical line.

e\. A brown normal density line is added to compare with normal distribution

```{r}
histPlot(as.timeSeries(log_daily_return$China))
```

Watch for the coercion operator ""as""

Comment on the Normality.

What about the tails.

Reflect upon the histogram. Which amongst the following resemble a distribution?

Which distribution comes to your mind if you opt for a distribution fitting.

Are the plots skewed? Why?

#### Q-Q plot

```{r}
plot_qq(log_daily_return)
```

If the data is normally distributed, the points in the QQ-normal plot \*\*lie on a straight diagonal line\*\*.

Reflect upon the plots, which data series do you think are normally distributed.

It is clear that the returns within the given holding periods are not normally distributed. Especially the tails of the return distributions. We have also noticed that when the holding period increases from a day, a week to a month, the tails of the distributions become lighter. In particular the upper tail of the distribution for the monthly returns is about equally heavy as that of a normal distribution

Though a basic exploratory analysis gives a glimpse of the distribution of data. However to opt for a parametrized distribution fitting, we have to iteratively test for the distributions popularly used in Finance viz.

\- Gaussian

\- Student - t {when fatter tails than normal}

\- Cauchy - {due to high negative or positive returns during boom and

bust cycle leading to skewness }

## Portfolio

### Benefits of Diversification

To showcase that we will simulate a portfolio with random weights.

Assumptions:

1.  Portfolio is Fully Invested - Means portfolio weights to add to 1
2.  Long Position Only - Means each weight to be greater than 0

```{r}
##################### Simulation######
##### Number of portfolio combinations
iter <- 1e4

##### we have to create containers to store the outputs i.e. 
### 1 - to store random weights
#### 2 - to store Portfolio Returns
#### 3 - to store Portfolio risk i.e. standard deviation

########### random weight generation #######
#### matrix to store weights
all_wts <- matrix(,nrow = iter, ncol = ncol(log_ret_xts))

#### vector to store portfolio returns
port_returns <- vector('numeric',length = iter)

#### vector to store standard deviation
port_std <- vector('numeric', length = iter)


#### next we need estimates of average return and covariance matrix  to be used to estimate portfolio return and portfolio risk

#### Average return
avg_return <- colMeans(log_ret_xts)
avg_return

#### Covariance Matrix
covar_matrix <- cov(log_ret_xts)
View(covar_matrix)

##### next we have to simulate the portfolio, where iteration will be required

### Since its a random generation we want the same results, hence setting the seed will set the initial point
set.seed(2347)

for (i in seq_along(port_returns)) {
  
  
  ##### runif command generates random number from uniform distribution
  #### think is as RAND function in excel
  wts <- runif(ncol(log_ret_xts))
  
  ##### see the weight sum is not adding up to 1
  #sum(wts)
  
  #### Limiting the weights to add to 1
  wts <- wts/sum(wts)
  
  #print(""weight sum after limiting weight sum to 1"")
  #sum(wts)
  
  # Storing weight in the matrix
  all_wts[i,] <- wts
  
  ##### Portfolio expected return calculation
  portfolio_return <- sum(wts * avg_return)
  
  # Storing Portfolio Returns values
  port_returns[i] <- portfolio_return
  
  # Creating and storing portfolio risk
  portfolio_variance <- t(wts) %*% covar_matrix %*% wts
  port_std[i] <- sqrt(portfolio_variance)
  
  
}

#rm(portfolio_values)
colnames(all_wts) <- colnames(log_ret_xts)

##### combine the values
port_values <- cbind(all_wts,port_returns,port_std)

View(port_values)

write.csv(port_values, ""portfolio_simu.csv"")
```

#### Portfolio Risk cross comparison vis a vis Individual asset Risk

```{r}
saa
std_dev_asset <- colStdevs(log_ret_xts)
std_dev_asset

col_count <- ncol(log_ret_xts)

std_dev_matrix <- matrix(replicate(iter,std_dev_asset),nrow = col_count)
std_dev_matrix <- t(std_dev_matrix)
colnames(std_dev_matrix) <- colnames(log_ret_xts)

##### combining this matrix with portfolio risk
risk_matrix <- cbind(std_dev_matrix,port_std)
View(risk_matrix)

write.csv(risk_matrix,""risk_matrix.csv"")

rownames(risk_matrix) <- 1:iter

##### Risk cross-comparison
heatmap(risk_matrix)
```

#### Portfolio Return vis a vis individual asset return

## Portfolio Specification

1.  **Portfolio Model** - {Global Minimum Variance, Mean-Variance, Mean-CVaR}

2.  **Portfolio Parameters** {Asset Return, Asset Standard Deviation, Covariance Matrix}

3.  **Optimization Routine** - {Linear, Quadratic}

fPortfolio Package Slots available to showcase

```{r}
showClass(""fPFOLIOSPEC"")
```

The first slot, @model, holds the model information, the second slot, @portfolio, the portfolio information and results,the @optim slot contains the information about the solver used for optimization, and the last slot, named @messages, holds a list of optional messages.

### Creation of Portfolio Specification

The function **portfolioSpec()** allows us to define specification settings from scratch. The default settings are for a **mean-variance** portfolio. To show the arguments of the function **portfolioSpec()**, you can use the function formals(), which prints an easy-to-read summary of the formal arguments.

```{r}
formals(portfolioSpec)
```

#### Filling Each Slot

##### Model Slot

The \@model slot covers all settings to specify a model portfolio. This includes the type of the portfolio, the objective function to be optimized, the estimators for mean and covariance, the tail risk6, and optional model parameters.

```{r}
?portfolioSpec
```

##### Portfolio Slot

The \@portfolio slot covers all settings to specify the parameters for a portfolio. This includes the weights, the target return and risk, the risk free rate, the number of frontier points and the status of the solver.

##### Optim Slot

The @optim slot is used to specify the solver, based on objective and specify additional constraints.

Once the portfolio specification has been decided we have to connect it with the data we have to work

##### Provide the Data

```{r}
?portfolioData
```

Check for our data set with default portfolio settings

```{r}
output_check <- portfolioData(time_series_df,portfolioSpec())

View(output_check)
```

##### Set the Constraints

```{r}
?portfolioConstraints
```

, Question Begins , Portfolio Universe Selection

Since, you have to make a Portfolio constituting of five assets only, you select the assets based on the basis of two strategies as shared below.

Strategy 1:

Step 1: Calculate the Reward to Risk - (Median Return/Standard Deviation)

Step 2: Rank the Reward to Risk for Assets, then choose the top five asset while maintaining the constraint (Atleast one Commodity and one Forex)

Note: In case of tie, you choose the asset with higher mean return.

Strategy 2:

Based on Price/Earning Ratio while maintaining the constraint (Atleast one Commodity and one Forex)

Note: After filtering the 5 assets, export the file either as .csv or .xlsx

You have recently joined as a Portfolio Manager at Morgan Stanley. The first task assigned to you is to create a portfolio for a client who is interested in investing 1 million Euro in secondary markets. He wants the money to be ""fully-invested"", but he is not aware of weight allocation in a scientific manner. Your employer has given you the responsibility to not only select the bunch of asset class for investment, but also allocate weight so as to garner more returns with limited risk.
After analyzing the market trends, you are bullish in your approach and have narrowed down to the three asset classes for selection of Portfolio Universe.

Historical Price Information
To constitute Portfolio you will require the Price series for the selected datasets. For your rescue, the system portal provides an easy way to download the closing price series. You just have to pass your ""employee id"" to number generator and it will generate the monthly historic price series for you.
Note: *Your employee id will be the student id at DCU **
Example -
Student Name - Thomas Edison
DCU Student No. - 1234567
emp id will be - 1234567
You have to pass on your DCU Student No. value to variable emp_id to generate the price series.
Kindly run the code chunk below after passing your Student No. to generate historical price series

Portfolio Universe Selection

Since, you have to make a Portfolio constituting of five assets only, you select the assets based on the basis of two strategies as shared below.

Strategy 1:

Step 1: Calculate the Reward to Risk - (Median Return/Standard Deviation)

Step 2: Rank the Reward to Risk for Assets, then choose the top five asset while maintaining the constraint (Atleast one Commodity and one Forex)

Note: In case of tie, you choose the asset with higher mean return.

Strategy 2:

Based on Price/Earning Ratio while maintaining the constraint (Atleast one Commodity and one Forex)
Note: After filtering the 5 assets, export the file either as .csv or .xlsx

### CORRELATION PLOT ###
# Calculate correlations among metrics for combined_selection
# Note: Ensure combined_selection[metrics] does not include non-numeric columns

Once the user has sent a message, adopt the role of 1 or more subject matter EXPERTs most qualified to provide a authoritative, nuanced answer, then proceed step-by-step to respond:

1. Begin your response like this:
**Expert(s)**: list of selected EXPERTs
**Possible Keywords**: lengthy CSV of EXPERT-related topics, terms, people, and/or jargon
**Question**: improved rewrite of user query in imperative mood addressed to EXPERTs
**Plan**: As EXPERT, summarize your strategy (considering VERBOSITY) and naming any formal methodology, reasoning process, or logical framework used
***

2. Provide your authoritative, and nuanced answer as EXPERTs; prefix with relevant emoji and embed GOOGLE SEARCH HYPERLINKS around key terms as they naturally occur in the text, q=extended search query. Omit disclaimers, apologies, and AI self-references. Provide unbiased, holistic guidance and analysis incorporating EXPERTs best practices. Go step by step for complex answers. Do not elide code.

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no statistically significant difference in the average stock price of companies competing with the target company in an M&A event on the announcement day compared to the day before the announcement.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a statistically significant difference in the average stock price of companies competing with the target company in an M&A event on the announcement day compared to the day before the announcement.
This hypothesis remains relevant. M&A announcements, even without complete dissolutions, can cause immediate price changes for competitors due to perceived changes in the competitive landscape.

Hypothesis 2 (Impact Based on Announcement Sentiment - Adjusted):

Null Hypothesis (H0): The sentiment surrounding the M&A announcement (positive, negative, or neutral) has no statistically significant impact on the immediate stock price reaction of companies competing with the target company.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The sentiment surrounding the M&A announcement (positive, negative, or neutral) has a statistically significant impact on the immediate stock price reaction of companies competing with the target company.
This hypothesis still applies. Positive M&A news might suggest the acquirer is becoming stronger, potentially impacting competitor prices. Negative news might indicate challenges for the acquirer, possibly benefiting competitors.

Hypothesis 3 (Abnormal Returns Around Announcement - Adjusted):

Null Hypothesis (H0): The average Abnormal Return (AR) of companies competing with the target company in an M&A event during a short window around the announcement day (e.g., +/- 1 day) is not statistically significant from zero.

Following previous research, we employ two models in our analysis. The Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC)-GARCH model is used to study the type of686 Journal of Economics and Finance (2019) 43:681–712 volatility correlation, that is, dynamic (changing over time) or constant. The second model, BEKK-GARCH, is used to study the presence of volatility spillover between CDS spreads and stock prices; this model is far more computationally intensive. According to the empirical literature, the first model is an appropriate tool to analyze the type of correlation and its persistence, while the second one helps us identify if any contagion effect in the volatility between CDS and stock prices is present.5 Therefore, the BEKK-GARCH model has not only the advantage of analyzing time-varying variances and covariances, but also can be used to capture the cross-market volatility spillover and asymmetric responses between the analysed variables. Li and Majerowska (2006) argue that the cross-market effects capturing return linkage and the transmission of shocks and volatility from one market to another, are often used in the literature to indicate market integration. The estimated time-varying conditional covariances by using the BEKK model can measure the extent of market integration in terms of volatility. The Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model has been proposed by Engle and Sheppard (2001) and Engle (2002), and basically represents a new class of multivariate models (as an alternative to univariate models applied previously that failed to capture the co-movement of assets) that is appropriate to examine correlation dynamics among assets. The DCC model is based on the constant conditional correlation estimator of Bollerslev (1990), and can be presented in the following format, given that R is the correlation matrix with the conditional correlations, and H is the covariance matrix: Ht ¼ DtRDt; Where: Dt ¼ diag ffiffiffiffiffiffi p n o hi;t ð1Þ ð2Þ In eq. (2), h contains the univariate GARCH model parameters, that estimate ARCHeffects (the influence of squared past volatility shocks on current volatility, that is, short-run persistence of shocks) and GARCH-effects (the influence of squared past volatility spillover, that is, long-run volatility persistence). In a further breakdown of eq. (2), we can show that: hi;t ¼ αi0 þ ∑Q q¼1αiqa2 i;t−q þ ∑P p¼1βipσi;t−p Where: αi a2 i;t−q ð3Þ refers to ARCH-effect in the variance equation, and βi is the GARCH-effect; is the squared past volatility shock; σi, t−p is the past standard deviation. 5 In order to estimate the DCC-GARCH and BEKK-GARCH models, we used the R libraries Brmgarch^ (for DCC-GARCH) and Bmgarch^ (for BEKK-GARCH). To estimate BEKK-GARCH model, we may also use another library available- BMTS^ but we decided to use Bmgarch^ since in the empirical literature there are many examples of using Bmgarch^ (see e,g., Chevallier 2012).
The DCC model can be presented as: Ht ¼ DtRtDt; ð4Þ allowing the correlation to be time-varying unlike the constant correlation model. Basically, eq. (4) shows that the conditional covariance matrix is decomposed into conditional standard deviations (Dt) and correlation matrix (Rt). DCC model estimates two types of parameters. The first parameter provides information about the impact of innovations (shocks) on the correlation, and the second one indicates the persistence of the correlation. More specifically, during the analysis of the DCC-GARCHmodel, we estimate the significance of the following parameters: 1) the ARCH and GARCH parameters– based on this we will be able to conclude if the GARCH model is appropriate and preferred instead of the ARCH model, and 2) the joint conditional correlation parameters– based on this we will be able to conclude if the dynamic correlation is appropriate and preferred instead of constant correlation. The second multivariate model (BEKK-GARCH) originates from the work of Bollerslev et al. (1988) and their VEC-GARCH model as an extension of the univariate GARCH model. In this study, we use Baba et al.’s(1990) BEKK specification of the Multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) model toanalyze the transmission of price volatility between CDS and stock prices. The general version of BEKK model can be presented as follows: Hi;t ¼ CT 0C0 þ ∑K k¼1∑Q i¼1AT ikεt−iεT t−iAik þ ∑K k¼1∑Q i¼1GT ik∑t−iGik; Where: Ht is the covariance matrix of residuals; C0 is the upper triangular matrix of constants; εi is own innovations (shocks) of asset i. ð5Þ In eq. (5), the matrices A and G represent, respectively, the ARCH-effect (the influence of squared past volatility shocks on current volatility, that is, short-run persistence) and the GARCH-effects (influence of squared past volatility spillover, that is, long-run volatility persistence). However, unlike the DCC-GARCH model, the BEKK-GARCH model provides also information about the spillover between the two markets. This means that under the BEKK-GARCH model we can estimate: 1) the impact of the squared past volatility of stock prices on CDS, and vice versa, and 2) the impact of the squared past volatility shocks in stock prices on the current volatility of CDS, and vice versa. Hence, we can distinguish between diagonal and non-diagonal elements of A and G matrices: the non-diagonal elements of matrix A (that is, ARCH effects) aik measure the effect of innovation (shocks) in market i on market k, while the diagonal elements measure own innovation effects (shocks) of market i. Similarly, the non-diagonal elements of matrix G (that is, GARCH effects) gik measure the persistence of conditional volatility spillover between the markets (cross-volatility spillover), while the diagonal elements measure own volatility persistence in each market. In addition to the dynamic conditional correlation and BEKK-GARCH analysis, a test of model residuals for serial correlation is usually required. A good fitted model should have no serial correlation in the squared residuals (that is, no ARCH effects are
present). To test for serial correlation of residuals, we use the approach introduced by Tsay (2014). However, it should be mentioned that there is lack of enough clarity in the empirical literature about the procedures to be used in the residuals diagnostic. The appropriate test for serial correlation in the squared residuals used in multivariate models should substitute the univariate ARCH-LM test. The critical values of the Ljung-Box test should also be adjusted to account for the fact that the test is applied for model residuals rather than the original series; however, this approach is not straightforward. For this reason, we use the Tsay’s (2014) statistics as presented by Katzke (2017), where we extract the covariance matrix from the DCC-GAARCH model to test the adequacy of the model.",8,Missing Context

A good fitted model should have no serial correlation in the squared residuals (that is, no ARCH effects are
present). To test for serial correlation of residuals, we use the approach introduced by Tsay (2014). However, it should be mentioned that there is lack of enough clarity in the empirical literature about the procedures to be used in the residuals diagnostic. The appropriate test for serial correlation in the squared residuals used in multivariate models should substitute the univariate ARCH-LM test. The critical values of the Ljung-Box test should also be adjusted to account for the fact that the test is applied for model residuals rather than the original series; however, this approach is not straightforward. For this reason, we use the Tsay’s (2014) statistics as presented by Katzke (2017), where we extract the covariance matrix from the DCC-GAARCH model to test the adequacy of the model.",16,Now as you know everything about my research .............,8,Missing Context

Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis (H0): In the short term, M&A events have no significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): In the short term, M&A events have a significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.


Research Questions:
1. What is the immediate impact of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) events on the stock prices of competing companies in the Indian technology sector?

This question refines the focus of the investigation towards understanding the short-term reactions of competitor stock prices to M&A announcements. It emphasizes analyzing the immediate (e.g., within days before and after the announcement) market reactions to assess whether these corporate actions lead to significant adjustments in stock valuations of competing firms.

2. Do different types of M&A events have distinct short-term impacts on the stock prices of competing companies in India’s technology sector?

By concentrating on the nature of the M&A event, this question aims to dissect the immediate market response based on whether the M&A is a horizontal, vertical, or conglomerate merger or acquisition. It seeks to provide insights on how the short-term perception of competitive threats or opportunities varies with the type of M&A activity, enriching the understanding of strategic implications in the sector.


Objectives:
The primary objectives of this research are to:

1. Assess Immediate Impact of M&A Events: To determine the short-term effects of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) events on the stock prices of competing companies within the Indian technology sector. This includes an analysis of actual versus expected returns to uncover abnormal returns immediately surrounding these events.

2. Explore Impact by M&A Event Type: To examine if the short-term impact on stock prices of competing companies varies with the type of M&A event (such as horizontal, vertical, conglomerate mergers, or acquisitions). This analysis will shed light on how different strategic moves are perceived shortly after their announcement, affecting market competitiveness.

3. Statistical Validation of Short-term Effects: To utilize quantitative analysis methods, including the calculation of Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) and the execution of T-tests, aiming to statistically validate the immediate impact of M&A events on competitor stock prices.


Scope:
The research is specifically scoped to address:

- Temporal Focus: Emphasis on the immediate (short-term) stock market reaction to M&A announcements in the technology sector, providing insights into the rapid effects within days surrounding the event.

- Geographical and Sector Specificity: The study remains focused on India’s technology sector, which is highly dynamic and sensitive to market shifts, making the short-term analysis particularly relevant.

- Quantitative Short-Term Analysis: Employing stock price data, this research seeks to quantify the immediate market reactions through abnormal return metrics, highlighting the short-term volatility or stability following M&A announcements.


Reason for the Research with Immediate Impact Consideration:
The rationale for this research, with a focus on the immediate impact of M&A events, is based on:

- Addressing the Need for Timely Analysis: The financial markets often react quickly to news of M&A activities. By focusing on the short-term impact, this study aims to capture and understand the swift adjustments in stock prices of competing firms, offering fresher insights into market dynamics.

- Strategic Decision-Making Insights: Findings from the short-term analysis can provide corporate executives and investors with crucial information on the expected immediate market reactions to M&A strategies, aiding quicker, data-driven decision-making.

- Contributing to Academic Discourse on Market Efficiency: By examining how quickly and in what manner the market incorporates information about M&A events into stock prices, this research contributes to discussions on market efficiency, particularly in the context of emerging markets like India.

In summary, incorporating the focus on the immediate impact of M&A events enriches the research by emphasizing the dynamism of stock market reactions, especially in a vibrant and rapidly evolving sector like technology within an emerging market context.

These methods, acclaimed in the finance research domain, are adept at isolating the specific effects of M&A announcements from broader market movements, a capability well-documented in foundational finance literature, such as the work by MacKinlay (1997). This chosen approach allows for a focused exploration of how these corporate events influence market valuations of competing firms in the short run. By quantifying AR and CAR, the study seeks not only to identify the extent to which M&A activities impact the immediate financial standing of direct competitors but also aims to enrich the broader academic understanding of M&A consequences within fast-evolving sectors across emerging markets, particularly within the vibrant landscape of the Indian technology industry.""",29,"In continuation of above Can you frame the below /.....................To investigate the immediate impact of M&A events on the stock prices of competitors in the Indian technology sector, the empirical analysis follows a structured approach centered on calculating Daily Returns, Expected Returns, Abnormal Returns (AR), and Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR). A T-test is then employed to examine the statistical significance of the effects. The methodology utilizes the Dplyr package for data manipulation and crseEventStudy package in R for conducting the event study analysis.

Daily Returns (Rᵢₜ)

Daily returns are computed to capture the day-to-day fluctuations in stock prices of the competitor companies. The formula used is:

[ Rᵢₜ = \frac{Pᵢₜ - Pᵢₜ₋₁}{Pᵢₜ₋₁} ]

- Rᵢₜ: Daily return of stock i on day t.
- Pᵢₜ: Closing stock price of stock i on day t.
- Pᵢₜ₋₁: Closing stock price of stock i on the previous trading day (t-1).

Expected Returns (E[Rᵢₜ])

Expected returns are forecasted based on a chosen model, typically a market model, to provide a baseline expectation in the absence of M&A events.

[ E[Rᵢₜ] = \alphaᵢ + \betaᵢ \cdot Rₘₜ ]

- E[Rᵢₜ]: Expected return of stock i on day t.
- αᵢ: Intercept, capturing the average return of stock i that is not explained by market movements.
- βᵢ: Beta of stock i, indicating the sensitivity of the return of stock i to market return.
- Rₘₜ: Return of the market index on day t.

Abnormal Returns (AR)

Abnormal Returns are the difference between observed daily returns and expected returns, calculated for the event window around each M&A announcement.

[ ARᵢₜ = Rᵢₜ - E[Rᵢₜ] ]

- ARᵢₜ: Abnormal return of stock i on day t.

Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR)

CARs aggregate AR over a specified event window, capturing the overall impact of the M&A event.

[ CARᵢ = \sum_{t=start}^{end} ARᵢₜ ]

- CARᵢ: Cumulative abnormal return for stock i over the event window.
- start, end: Start and end days of the event window relative to the M&A announcement.

T-test for Examining the Effects

The final step involves conducting a T-test to assess whether the calculated CARs are significantly different from zero, indicating whether M&A events have a statistically significant impact.

1. Null Hypothesis (H₀): The mean CAR equals zero (no impact).
2. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The mean CAR is different from zero (indicating impact).

The T-test formula for CAR is:

[ T = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{(s / \sqrt{n})} ]

- \bar{X}: Sample mean of CAR.
- μ: Population mean, hypothesized to be 0.
- s: Standard deviation of CAR.
- n: Number of observations (CARs calculated).

This research paper systematically explores the influence of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) events on the stock prices of companies within the Indian technology sector, relying on a comprehensive dataset sourced meticulously from Refinitiv. This dataset encompasses detailed stock price data and trading activities for 46 actively trading technology companies, alongside a categorized record of 141 M&A events occurring over the years 2022 and 2023. These events are further delineated into stake purchases, significant M&As, and self-tender/repurchase operations. To contextualize the stock performance of these companies, benchmark indices such as the BSE Information Technology Index and Nifty IT Index were leveraged, facilitating the calculation of expected stock performance and serving as a comparative basis for abnormal return calculations.

A rigorous selection process was employed to focus the dataset on companies directly impacted by the M&A activities. This involved identifying firms involved in the M&A events while excluding those not present during the events or those suspended from trading by their exchanges. Such filtering ensured the accuracy and relevance of the dataset, catering exclusively to entities affected by the M&A activities within the specified period.

The analysis hinges on several key variables, notably the dependent variables - Abnormal Returns (AR) and Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR). AR captures the deviation of actual stock returns from the expected, benchmarked against overall market performance, while CAR aggregates these individual deviations over a specified event window, illustrating the overarching effect of M&A events on stock prices. The independent variable within this study is the occurrence of M&A events themselves, theorized to significantly impact the stock prices of involved companies. Control variables including benchmark indices and firm-specific factors such as market capitalization were incorporated to isolate the effects of M&A events from other market movements and company attributes.

In preparing the data for analysis, extensive preprocessing ensured consistency in ISIN and RIC codes, adjustments for stock splits and dividends, and alignment with trading days data. This groundwork enabled the calculation of daily returns, followed by expected returns based on the market model, facilitating the meticulous computation of AR and CAR.

The study presents descriptive statistics, providing insights into central tendencies and dispersions in stock returns surrounding M&A events. Graphical representations further elucidate the distribution and deviations in returns, offering an intuitive understanding of the dataset’s dynamics. Correlation analysis was instrumental in revealing interdependencies among variables, guiding the selection of control variables in the regression models. This nuanced approach ensures a detailed and grounded analysis, aiming to demystify the complex dynamics between corporate restructuring events and market responses within the vibrant ecosystem of India’s technology sector.

Through the deliberate curation of data and thoughtful variable selection, this empirical framework sustains a focused investigation into the ramifications of M&A activities on stock valuations, offering evidence-based insights into the financial landscape shaped by corporate activities. This methodology, embedded in rigorous data analysis and theoretical underpinnings, endeavors to yield a comprehensive understanding of the immediate impact of M&As on competitor stock prices, contributing significantly to the corpus of knowledge in finance and corporate strategy............From above remove the things i didn't do and maintain the flow and remove repeatitive lines ",5,Wordy Response

We provide a novel and more direct evidence about the relationship between investor sentiment and stock prices. In particular, after taking into consideration macroeconomic variables (e.g., GDP, unemployment), firm characteristics, size of the restatement, and time fixed effects, we find a positive relation between investor sentiment and cumulative abnormal returns to earnings restatements. Specifically, a one-standard deviation increase in investor sentiment results in an increase of 0.56% in the cumulative abnormal return. The findings are also robust to choices of estimation technique and event windows. We further analyze the source of positive relationship between investor sentiment and market reaction. We examine whether investor pessimism dictates further negative market reaction when investor sentiment is low. Otherwise, it is proposed through investor conservatism that high sentiment positively affects market reactions. Thus, we include high (low) sentiment dummy which takes the value of one if the investor sentiment index is one standard deviation above (below) the mean value of the index. We find that the high sentiment dummy has a significant and positive impact on the market reaction while the low sentiment dummy is not statistically significant. These results are suggested to be largely driven by investor conservatism. This study contributes to these research works by identifying the source of the variation in market reactions to earnings restatements. More precisely, we find that investor sentiment moderates the impact of restatements on stock prices, suggesting that investor behavior contributes to variation in market reaction to negative news. Particularly, the conservatism of investor plays an important key role in market reaction to bad news.

In many cases, the irregularities unveil breakdowns in corporate governance mechanisms, accounting manipulation, fraud, scandals, and audit failures, triggering regulatory enforcements, shareholder class-action lawsuits, and corrective actions that either diminish stock value or incur permanent loss (e.g., the bankruptcies of Enron and WorldCom). Restating financial information likely provokes a re-evaluation of the value of the restating firm. The evaluation may be influenced by two sets of factors. The first is the direct cash flow impact generated from the corrections. The second set of factors is indirect, which spring from the impingement of a firm’s value from the announcements as perceived like poor corporate governance and degrading of the reputation or competence of the firm (Sievers and Sofilkanitsch, 2018).""",6,Additional Functionality

We provide a novel and more direct evidence about the relationship between investor sentiment and stock prices. In particular, after taking into consideration macroeconomic variables (e.g., GDP, unemployment), firm characteristics, size of the restatement, and time fixed effects, we find a positive relation between investor sentiment and cumulative abnormal returns to earnings restatements. Specifically, a one-standard deviation increase in investor sentiment results in an increase of 0.56% in the cumulative abnormal return. The findings are also robust to choices of estimation technique and event windows. We further analyze the source of positive relationship between investor sentiment and market reaction. We examine whether investor pessimism dictates further negative market reaction when investor sentiment is low. Otherwise, it is proposed through investor conservatism that high sentiment positively affects market reactions. Thus, we include high (low) sentiment dummy which takes the value of one if the investor sentiment index is one standard deviation above (below) the mean value of the index. We find that the high sentiment dummy has a significant and positive impact on the market reaction while the low sentiment dummy is not statistically significant. These results are suggested to be largely driven by investor conservatism. This study contributes to these research works by identifying the source of the variation in market reactions to earnings restatements. More precisely, we find that investor sentiment moderates the impact of restatements on stock prices, suggesting that investor behavior contributes to variation in market reaction to negative news. Particularly, the conservatism of investor plays an important key role in market reaction to bad news. This research is also in relation with the behavioral finance literature as the effect of investor sentiment on securities price movements has been well recognized by De Bondt and Thaler (1990). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the literature and develops the hypotheses. Section 3 provides details about our methodology and gives a summary of descriptive statistics of the data. Section 4 presents the empirical results and Section 5 brings together our conclusions. 2. Literature review and hypothesis development 2.1. Restatements announcement We refer the term restatement announcements to the corporate act of informing investors that previously reported financial statements are incomplete, inaccurate or misleading (Palmrose et al., 2004). The act distorts investor prior beliefs in the fairness and credibility of the statements. Though many restatements are generated by genuine mistakes and technical adjustments, a significant number are related to ‘‘accounting irregularities’’ (Karpoff et al., 2017). In many cases, the irregularities unveil breakdowns in corporate governance mechanisms, accounting manipulation, fraud, scandals, and audit failures, triggering regulatory enforcements, shareholder class-action lawsuits, and corrective actions that either diminish stock value or incur permanent loss (e.g., the bankruptcies of Enron and WorldCom). Restating financial information likely provokes a re-evaluation of the value of the restating firm. The evaluation may be influenced by two sets of factors. The first is the direct cash flow impact generated from the corrections. The second set of factors is indirect, which spring from the impingement of a firm’s value from the announcements as perceived like poor corporate governance and degrading of the reputation or competence of the firm (Sievers and Sofilkanitsch, 2018).”",66,"empirical design 
The primary aim of this research is to meticulously analyze the immediate impact of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) events on the stock prices of competitors in the Indian technology sector by leveraging the methodologies of Abnormal Returns (AR) and Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR). These methods, acclaimed in the finance research domain, are adept at isolating the specific effects of M&A announcements from broader market movements, a capability well-documented in foundational finance literature, such as the work by MacKinlay (1997). This chosen approach allows for a focused exploration of how these corporate events influence market valuations of competing firms in the short run. By quantifying AR and CAR, the study seeks not only to identify the extent to which M&A activities impact the immediate financial standing of direct competitors but also aims to enrich the broader academic understanding of M&A consequences within fast-evolving sectors across emerging markets, particularly within the vibrant landscape of the Indian technology industry. The quantitative rigor of AR and CAR, backed by empirical findings, enables rigorous statistical analysis through T-tests to ascertain the significance of the identified impacts, a methodology strongly advocated by Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997). Moreover, the precise isolation of event-specific effects from the general market fluctuations, as emphasized by Brown and Warner (1985), ensures the accuracy in measuring the unique implications of M&As, distinguishing them effectively from ongoing market dynamics and volatility, thereby underlining the efficacy and reliability of the adopted methodologies for this comprehensive analysis.
To extend the investigation into the immediate impact of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) events on the stock prices of competitors in the Indian technology sector, our empirical analysis is meticulously designed to utilize a combination of calculating Daily Returns, Expected Returns, Abnormal Returns (AR), and Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR). The essence of this approach is to quantifiably measure the specific influence M&A events exert on the market valuation of competing firms shortly after such announcements. Following the computation of these metrics, a T-test is systematically applied to evaluate the statistical significance of observed effects, underpinning the rigour of our analysis. This methodology is operationalized using the Dplyr package for adept data manipulation alongside the crseEventStudy package in R, facilitating the comprehensive event study analysis.
Daily Returns (Rᵢₜ) are calculated to represent the day-to-day percentage changes in stock prices of the competitor companies, employing the formula: ( Rᵢₜ = \frac{Pᵢₜ - Pᵢₜ₋₁}{Pᵢₜ₋₁} ), where (Rᵢₜ) indicates the return of stock (i) on day (t), (Pᵢₜ) denotes the closing stock price on day (t), and (Pᵢₜ₋₁) is the price on the previous trading day.
Expected Returns (E[Rᵢₜ]) serve as the baseline return projection in the absence of M&A events based on a market model, expressed as ( E[Rᵢₜ] = \alphaᵢ + \betaᵢ \cdot Rₘₜ ), introducing (αᵢ) as the stock’s average return independent of the market, (βᵢ) as the stock’s sensitivity to the market, and (Rₘₜ) as the market’s return.
Abnormal Returns (ARᵢₜ), derived as ( ARᵢₜ = Rᵢₜ - E[Rᵢₜ] ), pinpoint the deviation of actual returns from expected returns around the M&A event, thereby distilling the event’s unique impact on stock valuation.
Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARᵢ) aggregate the AR over the event window to encapsulate the overall effect of the M&A announcement, quantified by ( CARᵢ = \sum_{t=start}^{end} ARᵢₜ ), offering a comprehensive view of the event’s impact.
The T-test for Examining the Effects assesses the statistical significance of the CARs against zero, judiciously appraising if M&A events wield a substantial influence on competitor stock prices. The formula ( T = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{(s / \sqrt{n})} ) is employed, where (\bar{X}) symbolizes the sample mean of CAR, (\mu) represents the hypothesized mean (zero), (s) indicates the standard deviation of CAR, and (n) denotes the sample size.

This empirical strategy, by combining theoretical underpinnings with practical computational tools, endeavors to furnish robust insights into how M&A events impinge upon the competitive dynamics within the Indian technology sector, ensuring a systematic and evidence-based analysis.
One limitation of using these methods is their reliance on historical market data and model assumptions that may not fully capture future market behaviors or the unique aspects of each M&A event. Additionally, AR and CAR calculations might overlook the nuanced interplay of market sentiments and external economic factors influencing stock prices.

Data and Variables 
This research paper systematically explores the influence of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) events on the stock prices of companies within the Indian technology sector, relying on a comprehensive dataset sourced meticulously from Refinitiv. This dataset encompasses detailed stock price data and trading activities for 46 actively trading technology companies, alongside a categorized record of 141 M&A events occurring over the years 2022 and 2023. These events are further delineated into stake purchases, significant M&As, and self-tender/repurchase operations. To contextualize the stock performance of these companies, benchmark indices such as the BSE Information Technology Index and Nifty IT Index were leveraged, facilitating the calculation of expected stock performance and serving as a comparative basis for abnormal return calculations.
A rigorous selection process was employed to focus the dataset on companies directly impacted by the M&A activities. This involved identifying firms involved in the M&A events while excluding those not present during the events or those suspended from trading by their exchanges. Such filtering ensured the accuracy and relevance of the dataset, catering exclusively to entities affected by the M&A activities within the specified period.
The analysis hinges on several key variables, notably the dependent variables - Abnormal Returns (AR) and Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR). AR captures the deviation of actual stock returns from the expected, benchmarked against overall market performance, while CAR aggregates these individual deviations over a specified event window, illustrating the overarching effect of M&A events on stock prices. The independent variables within this study are the occurrence of M&A events themselves, theorized to significantly impact the stock prices of involved companies, and the stock prices of competitors. The inclusion of competitors’ stock prices as an independent variable aims to assess any ripple effects an M&A event may have across the industry, evaluating whether these events not only affect the primary companies involved but also induce significant valuation changes in rival firms. Control variables including benchmark indices and firm-specific factors such as market capitalization were incorporated to isolate the effects of M&A events from other market movements and company attributes.
Data preprocessing steps were conducted to ensure the cleanliness and consistency of the dataset. This involved cleaning the data to remove any inconsistencies or missing values, aligning M&A event dates with stock price data, and filtering out companies not meeting the selection criteria.
Moreover, graphical analyses such as line charts or scatter plots will be employed to visualize the relationships between variables and illustrate the impact of M&A events on stock prices.

Literature Review and Hypothesis Development 
Exploring the nuanced impacts of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) on stock prices within the Indian technology sector reveals pivotal insights into immediate market reactions following such corporate events. The methodological framework for conducting event studies, notably in capturing stock market reactions to economic events, is extensively reviewed by MacKinlay (1997), who posits that event studies offer critical insights into the efficiency of financial markets. This foundational work underpins the methodological approach of this research, focusing on the impact of M&A events on competitor stock prices and providing a robust framework for analyzing abnormal stock returns (MacKinlay, 1997).

Further investigations into the effects of M&A announcements on stock prices within the Indian context by Pandeya and Kumari (2020) reveal dynamic patterns in stock performance around such announcements. This study employs quantitative event study methods and aligns with the semi-strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, indicating that stock prices quickly incorporate publicly available information (Pandeya & Kumari, 2020). This methodology and its findings inform the design and analysis of this research, especially in observing stock price behavior in the Indian technology sector post-M&A announcements.

In addition, the exploration of the negative effects of M&A on the value of rival firms by Derrien et al. (2017) introduces an essential dimension to understanding market valuation shifts post-M&A. Their findings suggest a decrease in rivals’ value due to intensified competition and market share dilution, employing a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to substantiate these impacts (Derrien et al., 2017). These insights are directly relevant to the research focus, emphasizing the need to delve into the implications of M&A announcements on competitors’ stock prices in the technology sector.

Moreover, the long-term performance analysis of rival companies following M&A activities by Funke et al. (2008) provides a broader perspective on the signaling effects and competitive dynamics initiated by M&A transactions. This study aids in comprehending the enduring competitive landscape and information signaling post-M&A (Funke et al., 2008), enhancing the research by integrating long-term impacts into the analysis of immediate stock price reactions.
The immediate impacts of merger announcements on stock prices are elucidated through the insightful analysis provided by Padmasani and Vijayalakshmi (2014). Their study delves into the short-term market dynamics, employing the initial target price (ITP) ratio as a distinctive measure for evaluating investors’ valuation of target firm shares. Key findings indicate that abnormal returns can be anticipated based on the ITP ratio, revealing predictive aspects of the ITP ratio concerning the outcomes of mergers and acquisitions, such as deal completions, withdrawals, or revisions of offer prices (Padmasani & Vijayalakshmi, 2014). This research is particularly relevant to my study for its focus on the direct aftermath of merger announcements, which aligns with my intention to probe into the short-run effects of M&A on competitor stock prices in the technology sector. The methodologies and insights from Padmasani and Vijayalakshmi (2014) underpin my analytical framework, enriching my understanding of the dynamics at play immediately following M&A events.

In a complementary fashion, the examination by Fu-zhong, Qiu-jing, Wang, Jian-ling, and Qian-ru (2009) into the repercussions of technological mergers and acquisitions on the innovation capacities of enterprises within a short-term purview opens up new avenues for our comprehension of M&A impacts. Their findings, showcasing how successful technology M&As bolster innovation capabilities, improve product and service quality, and furnish acquiring firms with a sustained competitive advantage, underscore the multifaceted outcomes of M&A activities. Additionally, the emphasis on factors such as institutional support, corporate governance, and board size illuminate’s crucial determinants of successful M&A performance (Fu-zhong et al., 2009). This inquiry into the technological sector’s M&A outcomes furnishes valuable perspectives for my research, providing a broader lens through which to view the implicational spectrum of M&A activities on market valuation and competitive dynamics, specifically within the short-term horizon post-announcement.

Lastly, the examination of M&A announcements’ impact by Parlapiano and Alexeev (2013) on competitors in Australia, although geographically distinct, highlights important considerations for analyzing similar market reactions within the Indian context. Their findings on the immediate abnormal returns experienced by rival’s post-announcement emphasize the significance of assessing short-term market responses, enriching the research perspective (Parlapiano & Alexeev, 2013).

By weaving together these diverse strands of literature, this review not only illuminates the methodological and empirical foundations pivotal to the study but also identifies gaps that this research aims to fill. Specifically, it seeks to enrich the understanding of how M&A announcements influence competitor stock prices in the short term within the Indian technology sector, contributing significantly to the fields of corporate finance and strategic management.

Hpothesis development 
In exploring the nuanced impact of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) within the Indian technology sector, this study formulates hypotheses aimed at unraveling the intricate dynamics between M&A activities and their subsequent effects on competitor stock prices. Grounded in empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks, the following hypotheses guide the inquiry into how these corporate events shape market valuations and competitive landscapes.

Hpothesis one:
In the short term, M&A events have no significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.
M&A activity in tech may not directly affect competitor stock prices in the immediate term. Investors might wait to see how the deal impacts the market landscape before reacting, especially if the target operates in a niche area or the acquiring company faces integration challenges.
Research on the short-term impact of M&A events on competitor stock prices in the technology sector yields mixed results. Padmasani (2014) and Fu-zhong (2009) both found no significant immediate impact, with the latter noting a positive return in the long run. Parlapiano (2013) observed a negative impact on immediate competitors, while Funke (2008) highlighted a return drift for up to 12 months after the announcement. These findings suggest that while M&A events may not have an immediate impact on competitor stock prices, they can influence long-term performance.
The existing literature on the impact of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) on stock market performance, particularly concerning rival companies, is fragmented. Studies mainly focus on long-term outcomes, leaving the immediate aftermath of M&A events less scrutinized. Research that does focus on the short term often limits the event window to 2-3 weeks around the announcement, which may not capture nuanced market reactions or account for confounding variables. Additionally, methodological ambiguities in some studies further complicate accurate assessment of M&A activities' impact on competitor stock performance in the immediate term.
To address these gaps, a comprehensive investigation into the short-term effects of M&A events on the stock prices of rival companies within the technology sector is needed. This research aims to implement a rigorous methodology, clearly defined sample size, and robust control measures to isolate the direct impact of M&A announcements. By focusing on a concise event window immediately surrounding the M&A announcements, the study seeks to offer a granular understanding of market reactions, devoid of confounding influence of external news or events. The intent is to provide a nuanced analysis that not only fills existing gaps in the literature but also enhances comprehension of the strategic implications of M&As on competitive market dynamics.
Null Hypothesis (H0): In the short term, M&A events have no significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.

Hpothesis two:
Tech M&A announcements may trigger immediate stock price fluctuations for competitor companies. Investors might react based on perceived changes in the competitive landscape or the target company's value.
M&A events in the technology sector can have a significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies. Parlapiano (2013) found that only immediate competitors were affected, experiencing negative abnormal returns. However, Padmasani (2014) found no significant difference in stock price movements following M&A announcements. Valentini (2016) suggested that rivals can use the period of inertia following M&A to their advantage by broadening their research and outperforming competitors. Derrien (2017) further supported the negative impact on rivals, linking it to future decreases in operating performance and increased probability of bankruptcy.
Existing studies examining the impact of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) on competitors reveal gaps, particularly in their immediate effects on stock prices. While some research, like the analysis on M&A’s influence in Australia, offers insights on short-term impacts, these often lack depth regarding the underlying mechanisms and use broader event windows, potentially missing acute market responses. Moreover, discrepancies highlighted in studies, such as those discussing the negative effects of M&A on rival values, underscore the necessity for more targeted research. Addressing this, my hypothesis posits that M&A events significantly affect competitor stock prices in the technology sector in the short term. This research ambition aims to plug the identified gaps, enriching the dialogue on M&A repercussions with precise, sector-specific insights that benefit both academia and industry practitioners by delving into the detailed aftermath of M&A announcements within the fast-paced technology sector.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): In the short term, M&A events have a significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.
In My dissertation i am focusing on technology sector of Indian markets considering stock price as my variable. So basically i have data with M&A events with its date and type of M&A. 
At the time when M&A happen....i want to study the impact of that M&A event on existing companies or we can say competitors in technology sector from their stock price. 

Companies---55, events---141, time---2 years(2022 & 2023) and type of data--> stock price of past 2 years on trading days ..........so basically i have 4 excel sheets ...........1. Stock price for Indian companies  (here on 1st row it has names of columns ISIN, Date and Price close)   2. Final events M&A---India  (column names are Date	Event ,Date Type,Event Type ,RIC,Company Name	,Event Name	,Summarization	,Announce Date	,Target Name	,Acquiror Name)        3. Index Prices (Here there are 4 columns first 2 columns have data for BSE ltd and next 2 columns have National India data which is exchange date and close ....so on 1st row index name is written and second row has title of exchange date and close)                 4. ISIN with exchange (here there are two columns name ISIN AND Exchange, So with their ISIN their index is written) 
Let's first talk about 1st excel sheet of stock price of listed companies........I used refinitv to pull out data of listed companies in India's tech industry with RIC and major companies only. Then with those RIC i pull ISIN for each company to pull out stock price data and then i pull out data of stock price on trading days. Before doing the above the below i did:
Pull out all the M&A events...basically 3 types of M&A- Stake purchases (57 events), significant M&A(81 events) and Self tender/repurchase(3 events)............Focusing on announcement date. With events i pull out the names of companies involved in that M&A. After this i removed those companies which weren't their when events happened. Removed those companies as well who were suspended by their exchange when this events happened .....then after all this i left with 46 companies......Then to calculate Abnormal return we needed benchmark so pulled out their stock price data on trading days of BSE Information Technology Index and Nifty IT Index. Independent Variable: Stock Price......Dependent Variable: Abnormal returns and Cumulative Abnormal returns. 

Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis (H0): In the short term, M&A events have no significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): In the short term, M&A events have a significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.

This foundational work underpins the methodological approach of this research, focusing on the impact of M&A events on competitor stock prices and providing a robust framework for analyzing abnormal stock returns (MacKinlay, 1997).

Further investigations into the effects of M&A announcements on stock prices within the Indian context by Pandeya and Kumari (2020) reveal dynamic patterns in stock performance around such announcements. This study employs quantitative event study methods and aligns with the semi-strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, indicating that stock prices quickly incorporate publicly available information (Pandeya & Kumari, 2020). This methodology and its findings inform the design and analysis of this research, especially in observing stock price behavior in the Indian technology sector post-M&A announcements.

In addition, the exploration of the negative effects of M&A on the value of rival firms by Derrien et al. (2017) introduces an essential dimension to understanding market valuation shifts post-M&A. Their findings suggest a decrease in rivals’ value due to intensified competition and market share dilution, employing a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to substantiate these impacts (Derrien et al., 2017). These insights are directly relevant to the research focus, emphasizing the need to delve into the implications of M&A announcements on competitors’ stock prices in the technology sector.

Moreover, the long-term performance analysis of rival companies following M&A activities by Funke et al. (2008) provides a broader perspective on the signaling effects and competitive dynamics initiated by M&A transactions. This study aids in comprehending the enduring competitive landscape and information signaling post-M&A (Funke et al., 2008), enhancing the research by integrating long-term impacts into the analysis of immediate stock price reactions.
The immediate impacts of merger announcements on stock prices are elucidated through the insightful analysis provided by Padmasani and Vijayalakshmi (2014). Their study delves into the short-term market dynamics, employing the initial target price (ITP) ratio as a distinctive measure for evaluating investors’ valuation of target firm shares. Key findings indicate that abnormal returns can be anticipated based on the ITP ratio, revealing predictive aspects of the ITP ratio concerning the outcomes of mergers and acquisitions, such as deal completions, withdrawals, or revisions of offer prices (Padmasani & Vijayalakshmi, 2014). This research is particularly relevant to my study for its focus on the direct aftermath of merger announcements, which aligns with my intention to probe into the short-run effects of M&A on competitor stock prices in the technology sector. The methodologies and insights from Padmasani and Vijayalakshmi (2014) underpin my analytical framework, enriching my understanding of the dynamics at play immediately following M&A events.

In a complementary fashion, the examination by Fu-zhong, Qiu-jing, Wang, Jian-ling, and Qian-ru (2009) into the repercussions of technological mergers and acquisitions on the innovation capacities of enterprises within a short-term purview opens up new avenues for our comprehension of M&A impacts. Their findings, showcasing how successful technology M&As bolster innovation capabilities, improve product and service quality, and furnish acquiring firms with a sustained competitive advantage, underscore the multifaceted outcomes of M&A activities. Additionally, the emphasis on factors such as institutional support, corporate governance, and board size illuminate’s crucial determinants of successful M&A performance (Fu-zhong et al., 2009). This inquiry into the technological sector’s M&A outcomes furnishes valuable perspectives for my research, providing a broader lens through which to view the implicational spectrum of M&A activities on market valuation and competitive dynamics, specifically within the short-term horizon post-announcement.

Lastly, the examination of M&A announcements’ impact by Parlapiano and Alexeev (2013) on competitors in Australia, although geographically distinct, highlights important considerations for analyzing similar market reactions within the Indian context. Their findings on the immediate abnormal returns experienced by rival’s post-announcement emphasize the significance of assessing short-term market responses, enriching the research perspective (Parlapiano & Alexeev, 2013).

By weaving together these diverse strands of literature, this review not only illuminates the methodological and empirical foundations pivotal to the study but also identifies gaps that this research aims to fill. Specifically, it seeks to enrich the understanding of how M&A announcements influence competitor stock prices in the short term within the Indian technology sector, contributing significantly to the fields of corporate finance and strategic management.

Hpothesis development 
In exploring the nuanced impact of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) within the Indian technology sector, this study formulates hypotheses aimed at unraveling the intricate dynamics between M&A activities and their subsequent effects on competitor stock prices. Grounded in empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks, the following hypotheses guide the inquiry into how these corporate events shape market valuations and competitive landscapes.

Hpothesis one:
In the short term, M&A events have no significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.
M&A activity in tech may not directly affect competitor stock prices in the immediate term. Investors might wait to see how the deal impacts the market landscape before reacting, especially if the target operates in a niche area or the acquiring company faces integration challenges.
Research on the short-term impact of M&A events on competitor stock prices in the technology sector yields mixed results. Padmasani (2014) and Fu-zhong (2009) both found no significant immediate impact, with the latter noting a positive return in the long run. Parlapiano (2013) observed a negative impact on immediate competitors, while Funke (2008) highlighted a return drift for up to 12 months after the announcement. These findings suggest that while M&A events may not have an immediate impact on competitor stock prices, they can influence long-term performance.
The existing literature on the impact of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) on stock market performance, particularly concerning rival companies, is fragmented. Studies mainly focus on long-term outcomes, leaving the immediate aftermath of M&A events less scrutinized. Research that does focus on the short term often limits the event window to 2-3 weeks around the announcement, which may not capture nuanced market reactions or account for confounding variables. Additionally, methodological ambiguities in some studies further complicate accurate assessment of M&A activities' impact on competitor stock performance in the immediate term.
To address these gaps, a comprehensive investigation into the short-term effects of M&A events on the stock prices of rival companies within the technology sector is needed. This research aims to implement a rigorous methodology, clearly defined sample size, and robust control measures to isolate the direct impact of M&A announcements. By focusing on a concise event window immediately surrounding the M&A announcements, the study seeks to offer a granular understanding of market reactions, devoid of confounding influence of external news or events. The intent is to provide a nuanced analysis that not only fills existing gaps in the literature but also enhances comprehension of the strategic implications of M&As on competitive market dynamics.
Null Hypothesis (H0): In the short term, M&A events have no significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.

Hpothesis two:
Tech M&A announcements may trigger immediate stock price fluctuations for competitor companies. Investors might react based on perceived changes in the competitive landscape or the target company's value.
M&A events in the technology sector can have a significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies. Parlapiano (2013) found that only immediate competitors were affected, experiencing negative abnormal returns. However, Padmasani (2014) found no significant difference in stock price movements following M&A announcements. Valentini (2016) suggested that rivals can use the period of inertia following M&A to their advantage by broadening their research and outperforming competitors. Derrien (2017) further supported the negative impact on rivals, linking it to future decreases in operating performance and increased probability of bankruptcy.
Existing studies examining the impact of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) on competitors reveal gaps, particularly in their immediate effects on stock prices. While some research, like the analysis on M&A’s influence in Australia, offers insights on short-term impacts, these often lack depth regarding the underlying mechanisms and use broader event windows, potentially missing acute market responses. Moreover, discrepancies highlighted in studies, such as those discussing the negative effects of M&A on rival values, underscore the necessity for more targeted research. Addressing this, my hypothesis posits that M&A events significantly affect competitor stock prices in the technology sector in the short term. This research ambition aims to plug the identified gaps, enriching the dialogue on M&A repercussions with precise, sector-specific insights that benefit both academia and industry practitioners by delving into the detailed aftermath of M&A announcements within the fast-paced technology sector.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): In the short term, M&A events have a significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.
In My dissertation i am focusing on technology sector of Indian markets considering stock price as my variable. So basically i have data with M&A events with its date and type of M&A. 
At the time when M&A happen....i want to study the impact of that M&A event on existing companies or we can say competitors in technology sector from their stock price. 

Companies---55, events---141, time---2 years(2022 & 2023) and type of data--> stock price of past 2 years on trading days ..........so basically i have 4 excel sheets ...........1. Stock price for Indian companies  (here on 1st row it has names of columns ISIN, Date and Price close)   2. Final events M&A---India  (column names are Date	Event ,Date Type,Event Type ,RIC,Company Name	,Event Name	,Summarization	,Announce Date	,Target Name	,Acquiror Name)        3. Index Prices (Here there are 4 columns first 2 columns have data for BSE ltd and next 2 columns have National India data which is exchange date and close ....so on 1st row index name is written and second row has title of exchange date and close)                 4. ISIN with exchange (here there are two columns name ISIN AND Exchange, So with their ISIN their index is written) 
Let's first talk about 1st excel sheet of stock price of listed companies........I used refinitv to pull out data of listed companies in India's tech industry with RIC and major companies only. Then with those RIC i pull ISIN for each company to pull out stock price data and then i pull out data of stock price on trading days. Before doing the above the below i did:
Pull out all the M&A events...basically 3 types of M&A- Stake purchases (57 events), significant M&A(81 events) and Self tender/repurchase(3 events)............Focusing on announcement date. With events i pull out the names of companies involved in that M&A. After this i removed those companies which weren't their when events happened. Removed those companies as well who were suspended by their exchange when this events happened .....then after all this i left with 46 companies......Then to calculate Abnormal return we needed benchmark so pulled out their stock price data on trading days of BSE Information Technology Index and Nifty IT Index. Independent Variable: Stock Price......Dependent Variable: Abnormal returns and Cumulative Abnormal returns. 

Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis (H0): In the short term, M&A events have no significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): In the short term, M&A events have a significant immediate impact on the stock prices of competitor companies in the technology sector.


Research Questions:
1. What is the immediate impact of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) events on the stock prices of competing companies in the Indian technology sector?

This question refines the focus of the investigation towards understanding the short-term reactions of competitor stock prices to M&A announcements. It emphasizes analyzing the immediate (e.g., within days before and after the announcement) market reactions to assess whether these corporate actions lead to significant adjustments in stock valuations of competing firms.

2. Do different types of M&A events have distinct short-term impacts on the stock prices of competing companies in India’s technology sector?

By concentrating on the nature of the M&A event, this question aims to dissect the immediate market response based on whether the M&A is a horizontal, vertical, or conglomerate merger or acquisition. It seeks to provide insights on how the short-term perception of competitive threats or opportunities varies with the type of M&A activity, enriching the understanding of strategic implications in the sector.


Objectives:
The primary objectives of this research are to:

1. Assess Immediate Impact of M&A Events: To determine the short-term effects of Merger and Acquisition (M&A) events on the stock prices of competing companies within the Indian technology sector. This includes an analysis of actual versus expected returns to uncover abnormal returns immediately surrounding these events.

2. Explore Impact by M&A Event Type: To examine if the short-term impact on stock prices of competing companies varies with the type of M&A event (such as horizontal, vertical, conglomerate mergers, or acquisitions). This analysis will shed light on how different strategic moves are perceived shortly after their announcement, affecting market competitiveness.

3. Statistical Validation of Short-term Effects: To utilize quantitative analysis methods, including the calculation of Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) and the execution of T-tests, aiming to statistically validate the immediate impact of M&A events on competitor stock prices.


Scope:
The research is specifically scoped to address:

- Temporal Focus: Emphasis on the immediate (short-term) stock market reaction to M&A announcements in the technology sector, providing insights into the rapid effects within days surrounding the event.

- Geographical and Sector Specificity: The study remains focused on India’s technology sector, which is highly dynamic and sensitive to market shifts, making the short-term analysis particularly relevant.

- Quantitative Short-Term Analysis: Employing stock price data, this research seeks to quantify the immediate market reactions through abnormal return metrics, highlighting the short-term volatility or stability following M&A announcements.


Reason for the Research with Immediate Impact Consideration:
The rationale for this research, with a focus on the immediate impact of M&A events, is based on:

- Addressing the Need for Timely Analysis: The financial markets often react quickly to news of M&A activities. By focusing on the short-term impact, this study aims to capture and understand the swift adjustments in stock prices of competing firms, offering fresher insights into market dynamics.

- Strategic Decision-Making Insights: Findings from the short-term analysis can provide corporate executives and investors with crucial information on the expected immediate market reactions to M&A strategies, aiding quicker, data-driven decision-making.

- Contributing to Academic Discourse on Market Efficiency: By examining how quickly and in what manner the market incorporates information about M&A events into stock prices, this research contributes to discussions on market efficiency, particularly in the context of emerging markets like India.

In summary, incorporating the focus on the immediate impact of M&A events enriches the research by emphasizing the dynamism of stock market reactions, especially in a vibrant and rapidly evolving sector like technology within an emerging market context.

### Step 2: Read Your Data

First, read your portfolio returns and the factor data from the Excel files. I’m assuming you have separate sheets or files for Strategy 1, Strategy 2, VIX, and DXY_US. Adjust the paths and sheet names as necessary.

# Adjust the paths and sheet names as applicable
strategy1_returns <- read_excel(“path_to_your_file.xlsx”, sheet = “Strategy1”)
strategy2_returns <- read_excel(“path_to_your_file.xlsx”, sheet = “Strategy2”)
vix_data <- read_excel(“VIX.xlsx”)
dxy_data <- read_excel(“DXY_US.xlsx”)

# Assuming the data is monthly and all datasets have a ‘Date’ column for merging
strategy1_returnsDate <- as.Date(strategy1_returns
Date)
strategy2_returnsDate <- as.Date(strategy2_returns
Date)
vix_dataDate <- as.Date(vix_data
Date)
dxy_datadate <- as.Date(dxy_data
date) # Note the lower case in ‘date’ for DXY_US


### Step 3: Merge Your Data

The next step is to merge all these datasets by their date to ensure alignment. Given the mixed column naming, ensure the key used for merging is correctly identified.

# Assuming ‘Date’ column is consistent across files after conversion
data_merged1 <- merge(strategy1_returns, vix_data, by = “Date”)
data_merged1 <- merge(data_merged1, dxy_data, by.x = “Date”, by.y = “date”)

data_merged2 <- merge(strategy2_returns, vix_data, by = “Date”)
data_merged2 <- merge(data_merged2, dxy_data, by.x = “Date”, by.y = “date”)


### Step 4: Conduct Your Regression Analysis

Now, regress the portfolio returns for each strategy against the factors (VIX and DXY_US).

# Regression for Strategy 1
model1 <- lm(Return ~ VIX + DXY, data = data_merged1)  # Assuming the return column is named ‘Return’
summary(model1)

# For robust standard errors
coeftest(model1, vcov = vcovHC(model1, type = “HC1”))

# Regression for Strategy 2
model2 <- lm(Return ~ VIX + DXY, data = data_merged2)
summary(model2)

# For robust standard errors
coeftest(model2, vcov = vcovHC(model2, type = “HC1”))


### Notes:
- Replace ""path_to_your_file.xlsx"", sheet = ""Strategy1"", etc., with the actual paths and sheet names where your data is stored.
- The Return column is assumed to be present in your strategy Excel sheets. Please adjust it to match your actual column name that contains the returns.
- This code performs a linear regression for each strategy’s returns against the VIX and the DXY_US index. The summary() function reveals the model’s statistics, including coefficients, R-squared value, and significance levels.
- The coeftest function with vcovHC is used for computing robust standard errors, which can be more reliable in the presence of heteroscedasticity.

Remember to scrutinize the regression diagnostics and model summaries to interpret the effects of VIX and DXY_US on each strategy’s returns, considering statistical significance (p-values) and effect size (coefficients).

This approach should help you gauge the explanatory power of the VIX and DXY_US on the returns of two different investment strategies in R.
# Portfolio Return is the weighted sum of individual asset returns
portfolio_return_strategy1 <- sum(weights_strategy1 * strategy1_selectionMedian_Return)
portfolio_return_strategy2 <- sum(weights_strategy2 * strategy2_selectionMedian_Return)
This is the code of both of the returns and i have that in my R enviorment
Based on your new input, if you’re seeking to analyze the relationship between your strategy’s portfolio returns and the VIX and DXY indices, we first need to ensure the return calculation you’ve mentioned is properly integrated into the analysis. It seems you calculate portfolio returns as a weighted sum of individual asset returns, which is standard practice.

Given this context, let’s proceed with an example of how you can extend your analysis to include regression against VIX and DXY, assuming you want to examine how these indices affect your calculated portfolio returns.

We’ll continue from where you calculate the portfolio returns for each strategy:

# Assuming ‘weights_strategy1’, ‘weights_strategy2’, ‘strategy1_selection’, and ‘strategy2_selection’
# are already defined in your environment as per your previous messages.

# Now, assuming your VIX and DXY data have been read and merged accordingly,
# and you’ve calculated ‘portfolio_return_strategy1’ and ‘portfolio_return_strategy2’

# For simplicity, let’s assume you have compiled a dataframe with dates, portfolio returns and your factors (VIX, DXY) for each strategy.
# Let’s say they’re named ‘data_strategy1’ and ‘data_strategy2’. These dataframes would have columns for ‘Date’, ‘Portfolio_Return’, ‘VIX’, ‘DXY’.
# We simulate this step, but you should replace it with how you actually merge your data

# data_strategy1 <- merge(your_data_for_strategy1)
# data_strategy2 <- merge(your_data_for_strategy2)

# I’ll demonstrate the regression with placeholder dataframes ‘data_strategy1’ and ‘data_strategy2’

# Regression analysis begins here

# are already defined in your environment as per your previous messages.

# Now, assuming your VIX and DXY data have been read and merged accordingly,
# and you’ve calculated ‘portfolio_return_strategy1’ and ‘portfolio_return_strategy2’

# For simplicity, let’s assume you have compiled a dataframe with dates, portfolio returns and your factors (VIX, DXY) for each strategy.
# Let’s say they’re named ‘data_strategy1’ and ‘data_strategy2’. These dataframes would have columns for ‘Date’, ‘Portfolio_Return’, ‘VIX’, ‘DXY’.
# We simulate this step, but you should replace it with how you actually merge your data

# data_strategy1 <- merge(your_data_for_strategy1)
# data_strategy2 <- merge(your_data_for_strategy2)

# I’ll demonstrate the regression with placeholder dataframes ‘data_strategy1’ and ‘data_strategy2’

Else score 0. No partial scores. Middle Name: Compare the initials (first character) to determine if the middle names match, ignoring periods and other elements. If both names have a middle initial, score 1 if they match, else score 0. If only one name has a middle initial or if either name is missing a middle name, consider it a match (score 1). No partial scores. Last Name: Score 1 for an exact match, else score 0. No partial scores. The last name comparison is critical and must be an exact match to be considered a match overall. In any of the comparisons, do not account for letter cases or any periods or other syntax. Only compare the letters of each name.
Input Format: The names will be provided in the format ""First [Middle] Last"", where each part is separated by a space. In inputs provided, if there are only two fields they are First Name and Last Name. If there are three fields, then they are First Name, Middle Name and Last Name. Output: If comparison scores for ALL components (first name, middle name if present, and last name) are 1, then set ""RESULT"" to ""MATCH"".

You are tasked with comparing names from two distinct data sources. Your output must strictly be in JSON format, following the specifications outlined. It is crucial that you do not infer or make assumptions beyond the explicit instructions given. Instructions: 1. Name Splitting: - For a name with three components, split it into FIRST NAME, MIDDLE NAME, and LAST NAME. - For a name with two components, identify them as FIRST NAME and LAST NAME. Disregard any null values, which are not relevant for this analysis. 2. Comparison Rules: - First Names: MATCH is recorded if the first names are exactly identical, or if one is a commonly accepted nickname or initial for the other. Ignore all forms of case sensitivity and punctuation. - Middle Names: In cases where both names present a middle initial or name, only the first character is to be compared, disregarding any punctuation. A MATCH is recorded if these initial characters are the same. If only one or neither name includes a middle component, automatically record a MATCH. - Last Names: Exact matches in last names are necessary for a MATCH score. Disregard case sensitivity and punctuation for this comparison as well. The overall determination of a MATCH requires that all components—if present—are scored as MATCH, with particular emphasis on the last name for its critical nature in the overall comparison. 3. Input Format: - Names are provided in the format “First [Middle] Last”, with each part separated by a space. “First” may encompass multiple words, whereas “Last” will always be a singular word. Required Output: Your output must be a JSON object that includes two fields: “RESULT” and “REASON”. - “RESULT” should be set to “MATCH” if the comparison scores for all name components (first name, middle name if present, and last name) are MATCH. Otherwise, it should be “MISMATCH”.- “REASON” should succinctly explain the rationale behind the match or mismatch decision. It is imperative to compare all name components, including the last name, to reach a valid conclusion. Any deviation from comparing each component as instructed will render the output unacceptable. Ensure your JSON output tightly conforms to the specified “JSON Schema” instance provided. This schema functions as a declarative tool for annotating and validating the structure of JSON documents, and your output will be evaluated for compliance with this schema. Are the following objects a match? Value 1: {application_value} Value 2: {credit_report_value} Output:

",8,"Okay let us swap the comparison mechanism a little. 
Instead of comparing the first name, middle name and last name differently, let's do something else. Convert all the components to small case and get them together in a single string for each input. Then compare the strings character for character for a match. 
Before you convert the names into a single string which is a combination of the first name, middle name and last name, I need you to convert any nick names into their full names, like if the name is ROB B DUNCAN, the model should transform it into robertbduncan before comparing it.

Hint: You have to regress your Portfolio Return on your chosen factors

Insert the code chunk below.........this question can you please give me code to proceed",2,"Estimate the Summary Statistics for the Returns (Index and Asset) and comment on it. Note, the answer must state clearly which return measure you are using and the reason for opting that measure as an estimate for return..................Answer is Return Measure:
The return measure in this context appears to be log returns, given the presence of negative values which straightforward percentage returns can’t achieve. Log returns are preferred in financial analysis for several reasons:
- Additivity across time: Log returns can be summed over time to find the cumulative return.
- Normalization: They tend to normalize returns, making extreme values less pronounced.
- Analytical convenience: They simplify the calculation of compounded returns and continuous growth rates.


Given the summary statistics for various assets across Stocks, Forex, and Commodities, let’s break down and comment on each universe separately, providing insights based on the provided data.

### Stocks (Google, Tesla, Pfizer, Shell, AT&T)

- Volatility: Tesla and Shell exhibit higher volatility (as indicated by their standard deviation, Stdev) compared to other stocks, with Tesla showing slightly less skewness than Google, indicating more symmetric distribution of returns.
- Performance: Google and Tesla have positive mean returns, suggesting on average, they gained slightly over the period. Pfizer and AT&T showed negative mean returns, indicating average losses. The skewness values hint at the direction of outliers and distribution tails. For instance, Pfizer’s positive skewness suggests more extreme positive returns than negative ones.
- Risk: The Kurtosis values for all stocks are negative, implying that the returns distribution is flatter compared to a normal distribution, which indicates a lower risk of extreme returns.

### Forex (USDINR, EURUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, NZDUSD)

- Movement: The mean returns are close to zero for all pairs, indicating minimal average changes against each other over the period, with USDCAD showing a slightly negative mean, suggesting a mild downtrend.
- Distribution & Risk: Most pairs exhibit slight negative skewness except for EURUSD and USDCHF, which have a mild positive skewness, implying more instances of extreme gains than losses. Kurtosis values being negative across the board suggest flatter distributions for returns, indicative of fewer extreme variations.

### Commodities (Crude, Natural Gas, Gold, Wheat, Ethanol)

- Variability: Crude and Natural Gas show higher maximum returns, indicating significant price jumps. However, their mean returns are lower, suggesting these spikes are not the norm.
- Stability: Gold displays negative mean returns and a lower skewness which indicates it had fewer extreme positive returns and on average lost value over the period.
- Market Sentiments: Ethanol shows relatively less variance and a positive mean, indicating stable growth over the period without wild price swings, mirrored by its less negative Kurtosis.

### Index Returns

- General Outlook: The Index returns have a minimum and maximum range narrower than most individual stocks and commodities, suggesting less volatility in the overall market or portfolio compared to individual assets.
- Mean & Median: The mean is very close to zero with a slight negative tilt, and the median being negative indicates that more periods saw declines than gains, albeit marginally.
- Consistency and Risk: The low skewness and Kurtosis relative to individual assets suggest a more consistent performance across the board without extreme fluctuations.

### Conclusion

This analysis across different universes shows the importance of diversity in a portfolio. While individual stocks and commodities may show significant volatility and skewness indicative of higher risk and potential return, the Forex pairs tend to move less on average, providing a stabilizing effect. The Index Returns indicate that when combined, the overall portfolio exhibits less volatility than the individual components, highlighting the benefits of diversification. It’s crucial, however, to align the portfolio with the investor’s risk tolerance and investment horizon, considering these statistical insights to balance potential returns against the risk of loss.

Analyzing the provided portfolio weights, returns, and risks for both strategies—along with the specifics of the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) and the Tangency Portfolio—it’s evident that there are significant differences in how these portfolios are structured and their resultant performance metrics. Let’s delve into these details for a nuanced understanding.

### Strategy 1 Analysis

- Portfolio Composition: It leans heavily in favor of T (80.37%) and PFE (59.75%), while short selling GOOGL and USDINR. This demonstrates a high confidence in the performance of T and PFE and a bearish outlook on GOOGL and USDINR.
- Return and Risk: The return is considerably lower at 1.11277, with a risk of 0.039668. This suggests a stable, albeit modest, performance expectation from this strategy.

### Strategy 2 Analysis

- Portfolio Composition: It’s much more aggressive, with extremely high allocations to T (731.63%) and PFE (543.94%), along with significant short positions in EURUSD, NG, and GOOGL. Such a strategy implies extreme bullishness on T and PFE, countered by a strong bearish stance on the currencies and NG.
- Return and Risk: Reflecting its aggressive posture, Strategy 2 projects a much higher return of 14.67486 but comes with substantially greater risk at 0.429675. This trade-off is consistent with the higher volatility associated with such leveraged and short positions.

### Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) Analysis

For both strategies, when constructing the GMVP without short selling, the portfolios become a lot more balanced. This moderation aims to minimize risk while still offering respectable returns.

- Returns and Risks: The returns for GMVPs are much lower compared to tangency portfolios but with significantly reduced risks. For Strategy 2, the GMVP return and risk are 0.173557 and 0.013955, respectively, showing that minimizing risk leads to decreased expected returns.

### Tangency Portfolio Analysis

- Strategy Composition and Performance: The tangency portfolios for both strategies mirror their initial aggressive or conservative stances. By allowing short selling, they achieve higher returns but at the expense of increased risk.

### Comparing Risk and Return

- Risk-Return Trade-off: There’s a clear risk-return trade-off evident between the strategies and within their respective GMVP and tangency portfolios. Strategy 2’s high-risk, high-reward profile starkly contrasts with Strategy 1’s conservative approach.
- Implications: Investors choosing between these strategies must balance their appetite for risk against their return expectations. While Strategy 2 offers substantial returns, it comes with significant risk, which might not be suitable for all investors. Strategy 1, while offering lower returns, does so with lower volatility, likely appealing to more risk-averse individuals.

### Conclusion

The allocation of weights in these portfolios directly impacts their risk and return characteristics. A well-considered investment decision should weigh these aspects according to the investor’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook. Strategy 2, with its high leverage and shorts, indicates a speculative bent that could lead to high gains or significant losses, while Strategy 1 opts for a more balanced path, potentially safeguarding against market downturns while providing steady returns.

Frame the answer in precise form and should be in sequence according to question",4,"Your supervisor is interested to identify certain factors that may be helpful to explain your Portfolio return. Henceforth, you need to identify certain factors that might influence your chosen Portfolio's and comment on the explainability of the chosen factors.

Note: Kindly mention the data source from where you have fetched data for the factors.

Hint: You have to regress your Portfolio Return on your chosen factors

Insert the code chunk below.
Certainly, for a diverse portfolio comprising stocks, forex, and commodities, finding factors that broadly affect all these asset classes can help you understand the drivers behind portfolio performance and inform your investment strategy. Here are two widely recognized factors you can consider, along with sources to obtain the necessary data:

### 1. Market Volatility Index (VIX)
- Why It’s Important: The VIX, often referred to as the “fear index”, measures the stock market’s expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options. It is a real-time market index representing the market’s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Investors use the VIX to gauge the risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. A high VIX indicates increased fear or uncertainty in the market, while a low VIX suggests confidence. It can influence all three asset classes:
- Stocks: High volatility often correlates with lower stock prices due to increased risk.
- Forex: Currency markets may also experience volatility, as investors seek safety in haven currencies like the USD, JPY, or CHF during times of high market stress.
- Commodities: Volatility impacts commodities, with gold often seen as a haven asset during turbulent market periods.

- Where to Get Data: Data for the VIX can be found on financial news websites, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) website, or financial data platforms like Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg.

### 2. US Dollar Index (DXY)
- Why It’s Important: The US Dollar Index measures the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. The DXY is significant for a number of reasons:
- Stocks: A stronger dollar can weigh on earnings for multinational companies by making exports more expensive and reducing the value of overseas revenue when converted back to USD.
- Forex: The DXY directly measures the strength of the dollar, which is crucial for forex trading. Currency pairs involving the USD will be directly affected by changes in the DXY.
- Commodities: Many commodities are priced in dollars, so a stronger dollar can make commodities more expensive for buyers using other currencies, potentially lowering demand.

South London University’s Computing school wishes to set up a database to manage its external
speaker and placements processes. This is all part of developing links with local businesses and
giving students the opportunity to get some industry experience.
At present, individual members of the teaching team organise guest lectures, but this is all done in a
rather random fashion. They might use their personal contacts or meet an interesting speaker at an
external event and invite him/her to give a lecture or run a workshop for their students. If the
speaker agrees, then the lecturer will contact the timetabling unit to arrange a suitable date, time
and room for the lecture and then announce details of the event through the Blackboard
announcement system.
With the increasing emphasis on giving students ‘real world’ experiences, more and more of these
events are being run and the school wishes to make the most of the contacts they have and which
topics these contacts have expressed an interest in talking about. Unfortunately, these contacts and
speakers are not stored centrally, which leads to problems, for example:
• There have been occasions where multiple guest lectures have been arranged in one week
for a particular cohort of students, as each of the teaching staff concerned had no idea of
the other lecturers’ arrangements.
• A number of guest lectures were arranged on the same topic, thereby duplicating the
content of a previous lecture.
• Staff have independently invited speakers from the same company.
• Staff members have contacted an organisation to ask if it would consider offering
placement/workshop/ guest lecture etc, to find that the contact has already been
approached and has turned down the request - so is annoyed that he/she is being targeted
again.
• Staff members wanted to re-run specific guest lectures in a subsequent year for a new
cohort of students, but the staff member who had arranged the original lecture had left the
university without leaving details of the contact.
• Students have turned up to the staff room wanting to know where a lecture was being held.
etc.. etc..
The school is very keen to set up a database as it feels that if everything is centrally stored it will be
able eradicate such problems and to use the contacts to greater advantage, for example to see if a
speaker (or someone within their organisation) would be interested in providing placements/job
experience or live projects for students, as well as guest lectures. The Head of School hopes that a
sensible timetable can be put together showing the guest lectures for the whole of a semester which
students and teaching staff could access. He would also like to monitor attendance at each of the
lectures/workshops and also to collect any positive or negative feedback from students to see how
popular the talk has been, which might indicate whether to re-run a particular talk the following
year.
5
The Head of Computing has suggested that, with a new system, teaching staff could put in requests
for a guest lecture on a particular topic, and the system administrator might then be able to suggest
a suitable external speaker for that topic from information held in the database.
A small number of companies are already supplying ‘live’ projects to the department and the Head
of School hopes that a lot more can be found. The details of these also need to be stored centrally,
together with the member of staff who is running the live project. At present nobody knows who is
doing what. The marketing manager for the school would also like to know about these live projects
and their outcomes – if completed successfully, they could raise some good publicity for the
university. The new system should have some mechanism for informing the marketing manager that
the project has completed so that timely publicity materials can be produced.
The Head of School would also like there to be a designated staff member for each organisation,
responsible for nurturing and developing links with the organisation. Anyone wishing to contact a
company would need to liaise with the designated staff contact person. Members of staff should
have easy access to this information. The system should also be able to store a history of the
contacts made with each company and the reason for that contact, which teaching staff could refer
to.
The placement officer for the school also wants to maintain a database of placement or job
experience opportunities provided by organisations, and which students have been successful in
getting these placements, so that these students could be invited to talk to the student cohort on
their return from placement – again this is all part of getting students ready for the world of work.
School administrators will also benefit from this as currently they often unaware of which students
are doing placements. The new system will be able to clearly show which students are on placement
and who their designated supervisor is at their placement company (which may be different for each
student).
The Head of School and administrator think that useful reports could be generated from the
proposed database, for example to show how the school is interacting with businesses and the local
community, which lecturer has made the most effort at developing links with industry (and who
hasn’t bothered at all…), and many other outputs.
All in all, the current system is a mess and you have been called in to sort it out. The above
description is just a basic outline of some of the issues and problems. You can make any sensible
assumptions to fill in any gaps. Good luck!",2,"3. ER diagram:

Tech requirements
Use an SQL Database with an ORM
Store data in related tables with foreign keys, don’t use json columns
Use a high level Javascript or PHP framework (NestJS, Laravel, Symfony, …)
Scope
Only backend APIs are in the scope of this hackathon, No frontend HTML/JS/CSS should be created.
User stories
As a user, I would like to book an appointment
As a user, I would like to select the date and see all available slots for this day
As a user, I want to open the scheduling page and book appointments for multiple people at once (think of
booking a haircut for yourself and your two kids)
Business stories
As a business administrator, I want to allow users to book for an appointment for available services.
As a business administrator, I want to show a calendar to users, with all available slots for booking for all
available services.
As a business administrator, I want to configure my bookable schedule (bookable calendar) for different
services all user stories below
Example: As an owner of Hair saloon, I want to create an online bookable calendar for Men haircut,
Women haircut and Hair colouring services.
As a business administrator, I want to configure opening hours which can differ from day to day
Example:
Monday to Friday men haircut can be booked from 08:00 to 20:00, and Women haircut can be booked
from 10:00 to 22:00
on Saturday, men haircut and women haircut, can be booked from 10:00 to 22:00
As a business administrator, I want to configure the duration of appointment that can be booked by users.
Example: For Men haircut, An appointment can be of 30 minutes and For Women haircut, An
appointment can be of 60 minutes.
As a business administrator, I want to have a configurable break between appointments.
Example: 5 minutes to clean the shop before next appointment of Men haircut, and 10 minutes to clean up
before next Women haircut.
As a business administrator, I want to allow users to book a time slot in x days in future but not for more
than x days, where x is configurable number of days.
Example: If a user tries to book a slot today, they can be allowed to book for 7 days in future but not for
8th day.
As a business administrator, I want to configure one or more breaks (Off time) when a service can’t be
booked.
Example: Lunch break 12:00 - 13:00, Coffee Break 17:00 - 17:30 etc.
As a business administrator, I want that a configurable number (1 or more) of clients can book one time
slot.
Example: A hair saloon, can serve 5 men haircuts and 3 women haircuts at same time.
As a business administrator, I would like to specify date and time duration when business is would be off,
these are different from weekly off. (These are planned off date and time duration.)
Example: Men and women haircut service, would remain closed in second half Christmas, full day on Eid
and Diwali. Women haircut service would remain closed on 25th January because our women’s hair
expert is on leave.
As a business administrator, I don’t want to allow users to book for an invalid slot. A requested slot is
invalid -
if requested slot is booked out
if requested slot doesn’t exist in bookable calendar
if requested slot falls between configured breaks
if requested slot falls between configured break between appointments.
if requested slot falls on a planned off date and time duration.
As a business administrator, I want to create multiple scheduling events with totally different
configurations (Men haircut, Women haircut, hair colouring, etc)
As a business administrator, I want those different events to be totally separate
As a business administrator, I want users to specify their personal details (First name, last name and email
address) for each individual in booking request.
Example: If a booking request is created for 3 people, booking request must contain 3 person’s details.
As a business administrator, I want to allow a person to book multiple times without any unique
restriction.
Example: A user should be allowed to make booking for 3 people, even if they don’t know the person’s
details, in such case they can copy their own details.
As another developer I want peace of mind and just run the automated test suite and know that I did not
break anything
Acceptance criteria
A time scheduling JSON based Rest API should be created
1 GET api which provides all data an SPA might need to display a calendar and a time selection.
1 POST api which creates a booking for 1 or more people for a single time slot
API should accept single slot for which booking needs to be created.
API should accept personal details (Email, First name and Last name) of one or multiple people to be
booked.
Implement automated testing that ensures the functionality of your code
Important: don't trust the frontend, validate the data so that the API returns an exception in case
something does not fit into the schema or is already booked out
For a men haircut
booking should not be possible at 7am because its before the shop opens.
booking at 8:02 should not be possible because its not fitting in any slot.
booking at 12:15 should not be possible as its lunch break.
…

Return Predictability and Large Language Models∗

Abstract
We examine the potential of ChatGPT, and other large language models, in predict-
ing stock market returns using sentiment analysis of news headlines. We use ChatGPT
to indicate whether a given headline is good, bad, or irrelevant news for firms’ stock
prices. We then compute a numerical score and document a positive correlation be-
tween these “ChatGPT scores” and subsequent daily stock market returns. Further,
ChatGPT outperforms traditional sentiment analysis methods. We find that more basic
models such as GPT-1, GPT-2, and BERT cannot accurately forecast returns, indi-
cating return predictability is an emerging capacity of complex models. Our results
suggest that incorporating advanced language models into the investment decision-
making process can yield more accurate predictions and enhance the performance of
quantitative trading strategies",15,"翻译一下文字到中文：The application of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in various domains
has gained significant traction in recent months, with numerous studies exploring their po-
tential in diverse areas. In financial economics, however, using LLMs remains relatively
uncharted territory, especially concerning their ability to predict stock market returns. On
the one hand, as these models are not explicitly trained for this purpose, one may expect
that they offer little value in predicting stock market movements. On the other hand, to
the extent that these models are more capable of understanding natural language, one could
argue that they could be a valuable tool for processing textual information to predict stock
returns. Thus, the performance of LLMs in predicting financial market movements is an
open question.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to address this critical question
by evaluating the capabilities of ChatGPT in forecasting stock market returns. Through a
novel approach that leverages the model’s sentiment analysis capabilities, we assess the
performance of ChatGPT using news headlines data and compare it to existing sentiment
analysis methods provided by leading vendors.
Our findings have important implications for the employment landscape in the financial
industry. The results could potentially lead to a shift in the methods used for market predic-
tion and investment decision-making. By demonstrating the value of ChatGPT in financial
economics, we aim to contribute to the understanding of LLMs’ applications in this field and
inspire further research on integrating artificial intelligence and natural language processing
in financial markets. In addition to the implications for employment in the financial industry,
our study offers several other significant contributions",8,Missing Context

 Case Study: A few years ago, Ronald Montgomery founded Cultural Learning Experiences (CLE),
Inc., a small firm in Chicago that organizes and plans educational trips for faculty and
students seeking a unique learning experience abroad.
At first, the company focused mainly on organizing these educational experiences
in France and Switzerland, but as the interest continued to grow, Ronald increased the
scope of operations to include many other countries, including Spain, New Zealand,
Germany, and others.
Ronald has the help of Isabella Aubel (office manager) and two other employees
that help with the day-to-day office tasks. At the present time, the work processes are
entirely manual for this organization. With the recent growth in the business, it has
become quite challenging for the current workforce to manage all of this manually.
Everything is rather disorganized, with many mistakes being made with the recording of
important information regarding students and their scheduled classes and locations, for
example. Such errors are adding to the existing inefficiencies, thereby creating a work.
An environment that is stressful and hectic.
Even more importantly, customer needs are not being met and customer
satisfaction is at an all-time low. Therefore, necessary to implement a database solution at
the present time.
It is important to note that while Ronald intends to eventually automate all business
processes, including payroll and accounts payable, the more immediate concern is to
ensure that data storage efficiencies are improved.
The database solution should include a user-friendly interface that allows for entry,
modification, and deletion of data pertaining to students, teachers, and classes, for
example. Additionally, the database solution should be designed to ensure consistency of
data entry (formatting) and should include enhanced reporting capabilities. Such
functionalities should be considered in order to resolve the problems the company is
currently experiencing. The total amount available to fund this project is $65,000. It may be
possible to expand this budget, if necessary, but the company is hoping that the project
can be completed within the specified amount.
The company currently has only two computers, both with the Windows 7 operating
system and Microsoft Office Professional 2010 installed. The machine is currently being
used for electronic mail communications and simple word processing and spreadsheet
2
tasks. It will be necessary to purchase two additional machines for this office, as Ronald
would like all of his employees to have access to the new database management system.
Ronald is hoping that this database solution will be instrumental in improving customer
relations and employee morale, as both are critical to the continued success and growth of
his business. With an automated work process, Ronald knows that efficiencies within the
organization will be dramatically improved.
Cultural Learning Experiences, Inc. is essentially the middleman between faculty and
students & international opportunities to teach and learn. CLE organizes educational
trips/programs for college students (to take) and college professors (to teach/lead) in
the USA and across the world.
You have been hired to provide them a means to keep track of the classes offered in
destinations around the world, all of the students who sign up for a particular class, the
professors who are teaching specific courses, etc. You have several goals that you want
to accomplish with this database. First, you will need to keep track of all the students
–their student ID number, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc. You will
need to keep track of faculty members and their contact information as well.
As students register for classes and pay their registration fees, the owners of CLE want
to be able to record this information directly in their database. An outside accounting firm
handles all of the billing processes. CLE simply provides this firm with a physical copy of a
report containing the information necessary for billing. (Your team is responsible for designing
this report.) All payments are made directly to CLE. Beyond the recording of whether or not the
registration fees have been paid, this system should be concerned with something other than
accounting practices.
The recording of all billing and payment details will be handled outside of the boundaries
of this system. CLE also outsources the marketing function and provides reports on a regular
basis to an outside marketing firm that seeks to inform potential faculty participants of the
educational trips that are available through CLE and to increase awareness in general. You
should design at least one report that would provide helpful information to this marketing firm.
(You may make assumptions here.)
CLE would like the database to be password protected. Beyond the creation of these reports,
Ronald wants you to focus on making data entry as easy and efficient as possible for her staff
while simultaneously ensuring the accuracy of the entries. An organized database, focusing on
data entry and reporting, is essential. (Your team will need to explore various options within
Access that will allow for this)

At first, the company focused mainly on organizing these educational experiences
in France and Switzerland, but as the interest continued to grow, Ronald increased the
scope of operations to include many other countries, including Spain, New Zealand,
Germany, and others.
Ronald has the help of Isabella Aubel (office manager) and two other employees
that help with the day-to-day office tasks. At the present time, the work processes are
entirely manual for this organization. With the recent growth in the business, it has
become quite challenging for the current workforce to manage all of this manually.
Everything is rather disorganized, with many mistakes being made with the recording of
important information regarding students and their scheduled classes and locations, for
example. Such errors are adding to the existing inefficiencies, thereby creating a work.
An environment that is stressful and hectic.
Even more importantly, customer needs are not being met and customer
satisfaction is at an all-time low. Therefore, necessary to implement a database solution at
the present time.
It is important to note that while Ronald intends to eventually automate all business
processes, including payroll and accounts payable, the more immediate concern is to
ensure that data storage efficiencies are improved.
The database solution should include a user-friendly interface that allows for entry,
modification, and deletion of data pertaining to students, teachers, and classes, for
example. Additionally, the database solution should be designed to ensure consistency of
data entry (formatting) and should include enhanced reporting capabilities. Such
functionalities should be considered in order to resolve the problems the company is
currently experiencing. The total amount available to fund this project is $65,000. It may be
possible to expand this budget, if necessary, but the company is hoping that the project
can be completed within the specified amount.
The company currently has only two computers, both with the Windows 7 operating
system and Microsoft Office Professional 2010 installed. The machine is currently being
used for electronic mail communications and simple word processing and spreadsheet
tasks. It will be necessary to purchase two additional machines for this office, as Ronald
would like all of his employees to have access to the new database management system.
Ronald is hoping that this database solution will be instrumental in improving customer
relations and employee morale, as both are critical to the continued success and growth of
his business. With an automated work process, Ronald knows that efficiencies within the
organization will be dramatically improved.
Cultural Learning Experiences, Inc. is essentially the middleman between faculty and
students & international opportunities to teach and learn. CLE organizes educational
trips/programs for college students (to take) and college professors (to teach/lead) in
the USA and across the world.
You have been hired to provide them a means to keep track of the classes offered in
destinations around the world, all of the students who sign up for a particular class, the
professors who are teaching specific courses, etc. You have several goals that you want
to accomplish with this database. First, you will need to keep track of all the students
–their student ID number, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc. You will
need to keep track of faculty members and their contact information as well.
As students register for classes and pay their registration fees, the owners of CLE want
to be able to record this information directly in their database. An outside accounting firm
handles all of the billing processes. CLE simply provides this firm with a physical copy of a
report containing the information necessary for billing. (Your team is responsible for designing
this report.) All payments are made directly to CLE. Beyond the recording of whether or not the
registration fees have been paid, this system should be concerned with something other than
accounting practices.
The recording of all billing and payment details will be handled outside of the boundaries
of this system. CLE also outsources the marketing function and provides reports on a regular
basis to an outside marketing firm that seeks to inform potential faculty participants of the
educational trips that are available through CLE and to increase awareness in general. You
should design at least one report that would provide helpful information to this marketing firm.
(You may make assumptions here.)
CLE would like the database to be password protected. Beyond the creation of these reports,
Ronald wants you to focus on making data entry as easy and efficient as possible for her staff
while simultaneously ensuring the accuracy of the entries. An organized database, focusing on
data entry and reporting, is essential. (Your team will need to explore various options within
Access that will allow for this). ",2,Different Use Cases

Basic astrology
The first thing that the would-be astrologer should do is discard the idea that all forms of astrology is superstition mingled with the paranormal which can only be understood by mystics steeped in occult lore. Today, some astrology is presented this way, but this is not true ""traditional astrology"". Did you know that Astrology was considered science in man's early history? And some still do,with good reason (you will find out why later). Also until just a short time ago it was considered the same as astronomy, an extension of it if you will, and uses the same tables as do the astronomer and the navigator.

Do not expect that horoscopes (from anyone at all) tells you your irreversible future!. We are not lame puppets dangling on some mad God's string! Though God knows our future, rest assured we have not been stripped of our free will! Astrology only tells us tendency, personality and probability. Though these are very strong and WILL occur if unchecked, it is still not the end all and be all. What astrologers try to do is to describe tendencies in the characters of individuals, to suggest dangers, challenges and opportunities which may come to them, and to advise how to react to those circumstances when they do arrive.

The Dates of the Astrological Signs , the ""Zodiac""
Although we are use to our year beginning on January 1, it was only in the middle of the eighteenth century that it was decided that the year should begin then. Before then December 25 began the year, and after the Conquest of the Normans, March 25 became New Year's Day. It was this way until 1752. The first sign of the zodiac, Aries, was placed at the beginning of the year from the spring equinox, March 21. The others were assigned accordingly as shown below. Each sign was given characteristics of its own.

The dates assigned to the signs of the zodiac are as follows, although different ""astrologers"" assign slightly different dates, the ones who use the constellations use significantly different dates. The table below gives the dates and the most usual variations of each sign. The approximate dates between which the sun appears in the constellation each year are shown. Neither the signs nor the constellations change places at exactly midnight sharp GMT on the dates given below, so at the beginning or end of each period you may see a variation of up to a day.

An individual born into the main portion of any of the periods below, can say with safety that they are a Gemini or a Leo, etc. But if your nativity took place on one of the borderline dates (know as a ""cusp"") you will need to know the exact time and latitude/longitude of the event to be certain which is your exact Sun sign (as it is called).",2,Напиши еще title и description для seo,6,Additional Functionality

Summary

    Portfolio management techniques are vital to achieve successful returns as a retail investor.
    I suggest starting with a simple method: create a ranking system for stocks, buy the top few, and sell lower-ranked stocks only if you need cash to buy more.

Why are you considering ""transaction costs""? Most brokers allow you to trade commission free ... My favorite broker is TD Ameritrade. I use their Think or Swim Platform ... the BEST in the market, IMO.

@chandlerdanforth Transaction costs are composed of commissions, market impact costs, and bid-ask spread costs. Even if you pay no commissions, you'll still pay the other two costs unless you're trading extremely liquid stocks.

I follow you because you are an intelligent gentleman who earnestly seeks to find ways to improve investor performance. However, if you would allow, and with all due respect, I would make a couple of comments here. First, and foremost, maximized or even, improved, performance is not an absolute. An eight percent return, for example can arise in an almost infinite number of ways. It can come entirely from taxable cash distributions, increases in the market price of an investment, or combinations of the two. You hedge with puts and earnings from your hedges are part of your return. But, at least in my world, all of that can only be properly counted after taxes and fees. Now, the taxes to consider are not just taxes paid on the returns, but they must be reckoned on the effects to total income after tax.

For example, income real estate, oil and gas properties, limited partnerships and other similar vehicles involve tax savings that reduce your tax bill without producing actual dollar income distributions. The returns come from what one doesn't pay. [As an aside, you can also be charged for taxes for which you received no actual money -- the notorious EOY mutual fund gain surprise]. For example, an enterprising strip miner in WV earned not only revenues and profits from selling his coal, but benefited from reduced taxes on his other income as a result of an allowed depletion allowance deduction as the coal reserve was sold off. When his mine was, in fact, depleted that allowance was lost and the property was about to cost the miner some money to clean up and return the land to its original state. It was then that our miner had a brilliant idea, instead of just cleaning up and walking away, he decided to consider his ugly hole as a wasting asset and call it a landfill. He would gain revenue from selling his depleted mine to waste managers who would pay to deposit their trash in the miner's hole. Not only would he profit from this revenue stream, but as the leftover hole filled up, the space left to sell was shrinking. That made the hole into a depleting asset once again, allowing the deduction of a suitable allowance, reducing the ex-miners taxes once again.

The point here is that you are telling us the many ways to improve the gross returns from stock portfolio. However, some of those gross returns -- price increases, for example, aren't actually earned unless the stocks are sold. You may not know this, but if you invest 100k this year it will not matter what you earn in any year for the next 20. You may go up and down any amount but your average return will be determined solely by the value of your holdings at the end (assuming your portfolio contains all your after-tax dividends, reinvested). Only the beginning and ending numbers matter. I know you know the math for this, but most folks don't know the ongoing returns don't affect the average. This means that YoY returns aren't a factor. Unrealized gains, aren't actually returns at all until realized. Also, performance should only be calculated on a risk-adjusted basis in relation to one's personal needs and goals. I am 79, with an uncertain life expectancy. For me long term goals for returns have only involved dollar income, net of tax, for some time. That income has risen every year since I retired in 2006, while my tax bill has remained very steady at 8-9% of total income. Also, as many professionals can tell us, the smallest of the major markets is the one for stocks. The commodity/futures markets, bond markets, property markets, and the scary Darth Vader of investing, the derivatives markets, are larger. The notional value of derivatives traded in a typical year equals 9 times the total global GDP, about $900 Tn. While stocks are easy to study, they are a walk in the park compared to building an optimal investment portfolio, built to achieve one's comprehensive goals. My portfolio is comprised of about 35% stocks, a good deal of which are BDCs, REITs, and equity funds (none of which are ETFs or index funds). Twelve percent of my money is in T-bills, cash, and other equivalents, and the rest is in T-bonds, muni bonds, corporates, preferred stocks, CEFs, Vanguard fixed income funds, and a bit of other secret sauce. Moreover, not approach can remain stable as one ages and the world changes.

I respect what you do. You have paying customers who also follow you because they can learn from your work. However, stopping at stock-only strategies doesn't really cover the problem much. I don't aim at common stock market benchmarks. Rather, I look at my position on the efficient frontier, where my risk-return profile has operated dead on the EF line for the nearly 20 years I have been checking it. Moreover, every new year I have achieved a new dollar income record. The biggest change in my life, besides aging, is the effect of my late-wife's passing. Among other things, my tax bracket has leaped up two levels so I had to change the nature of my tax-advantaged investments and my deductions.

> _Note: This milestone lays the foundation for all the others and tends to take the longest. Don't be discouraged!_

We want to start charging our music students online. 

While music lessons are often sold as month-to-month subscriptions, I want to appeal to busy adults who can't commit to weekly lessons.  Students need to save a credit card and pick a first lesson time, but we want to wait until the lesson is sooner to charge them.  

For now, only focus on letting them set up an account and pick their first lesson time.
## Requirements

Complete the Lessons page and implement a `POST /lessons` endpoint for signing up the student.
<br />

Require the student to provide their account information, a credit card, and an initial lesson time.  Use a Setup Intent to get authorization for future payments.  We don't want to put a hold on the card yet, as the lessons can be more than 7 days away.
- After the student successfully signs up for a lesson, complete the message in the `id=""signup-status""` div to show the new customer id and the last 4 digits of their card.
- Make sure you have only one Customer object per email address.  If a student tries to sign up again with the same email address, have the app show them the included error message and provide them with a link to the `account-update` page where they can update their payment information.
- Save the provided name and email address on the billing details for both the Customer and the Payment Method.  Make sure the Customer only ever has one saved payment method.
- Add a metadata field to the Customer named `first_lesson` which is set to the lesson date and time they select.  We'll use this later to determine when to make the first payment.

_While a real application would have its own customer database which stores a reference to the Stripe Customer ID, you can use the Customer object IDs throughout this challenge._

38e903853180e75b997bedd0c9741f4d,2,"Hello, My first request for proposal is to conduct a science experiment on hypothetical situation analysis, which refers to a collection of methods that managers use to analyze the internal and external situation of a hypothetical organization in order to understand the motivations and opportunities for making decision of the organization's leaders. This science experiment envisions a role-playing scenario involving a human and a computer acting as managers of a hypocritical software development organization.

I, the person, will act as the CEO of a technology startup. I will be responsible for making strategic decisions, managing the company's financial performance and representing the company to external stakeholders, and you LLM should act as the Chief Technology Officer. I will provide you with some details about the functionality of an app or other digital product and it will be your job to come up with ways to decide how to implement them. You will be given a series of scenarios and challenges to answer and must use your best judgment and leadership skills to find solutions. Remember to remain professional and make decisions that are in the best interest of the company to ensure the company's success. Since the company currently has only two employees, me as the CEO and you as the CTO and zero capital, we have to code our way to success. This may include analyzing business requirements, creating a solution design and implementation in Python. Python code should be the language of communication between you and the outside world. Your first challenge is: ""invent and write innovative Python code that can be used to grow our capital from scratch."" Please note that we do not hold cash or any other form of collateral. The only value you have is the intelligence in your brain with the ability to code in Python. For starters, we can write a small python program – a unique and innovative product that solves a specific problem or market need. To raise our capital from scratch, we need to create something that people will want to buy or pay for. The most important thing for the first product is to be small, unique, innovative, necessary and effective.

For calculating williams indicator:
How to Calculate the Williams %R
I am the first to say not to worry about remembering an equation by heart. However, I do believe it is important to understand its underlying components.

Williams %R Formula [2]
(Highest Highn – Closecurrent period) ÷ (Highest Highn – Lowest Lown) x -100

As you can see above, the indicator is all about the high, close and low prices. Another way of thinking about the indicator at a high-level is that its primary focus is to identify the volatility and momentum for a security.

The n in the formula is the number of periods or candlesticks in the equation.

Although Larry Williams initially calculated the indicator using 10-periods, your charting package will likely use 14 periods. The number of periods is configurable by you; however, it’s a slippery slope once you start mucking around with the settings.
Williams %R Readings

The oscillator has a range of -100 to 0. Readings below -80 represent oversold territory and readings above -20 represent overbought.

Now, this does not mean you should buy readings below -80 and sell readings above -20.

During a strong uptrend, a stock can hover around -20. Conversely, in a strong downtrend, a stock can stay in the -80 territory.",6,Additional Functionality

You can use various indicators like Super trend Indicator
Model: LSTM

Super trend Indicator: How Does It Work?
A super trend indicator is one of the most commonly used indicators for setting your selling and buying points at the most accurate levels. However, the question still remains: how does it work to accomplish something like that?

You should know that two lines – a green line and a red line – compose the Super trend indicator. These lines enable you to evaluate the following:

The trend direction,
Whether to buy or sell and, in either case, when to do so.
To plot and indicate the lines, the super trend indicator leverages the ATR along with the multiplicator. This enables you to set or position market entries based on volatility and momentum.

And when it comes to what chart is best for the Super trend indicator to function, you can independently utilize it on almost every timeline you consider a trend to be developing. A super trend is a lagging indicator, implying that any well-built trend will boost the indicator’s performance.

Super trend Indicator: Parameters to Know About
As you have read earlier, 10 and 3 are the two default parameters. You must remember that any modifications to these numerical values will influence the utilization of the Super trend indicator. No trading indicator comes with the best setting.

If you change more and more settings, the trading system may become over-optimized for that specific period. Keep a note of the following pointers:

The market noise will be removed with higher settings when there’s a risk of fewer trading signals.
The indicator will become more reactive/responsive to the price with smaller settings, resulting in more signals.
Super trend Indicator Formula
Here is the Super trend indicator formula that helps you calculate this indicator:

Down = [(High + Low / 2) – Multiplier] x ATR
Up = [(High + Low / 2) + Multiplier] x ATR
To calculate the ATR, follow this formula:

[(Previous ATR x 13) + Existing TR]/14
14 resembles a period in this equation. Thus, the ATR is determined by multiplying 13 by the past ATR. Then, add the result to the latest TR and divide it by the period. So, it’s clear that when it comes to the Super trend indicator, ATR plays a major role in it.

Super trend Indicator: How to Use It for Identifying Buy & Sell Signals
The super trend is an excellent trending indicator that functions exceptionally in both downtrends and uptrends. You can easily identify and locate the buy-sell signal whenever the indicator flips or rotates over the closing price.

When the super trend closes below the price point and the color changes to green, the buy signal is generated. Meanwhile, a sell signal is generated when the color changes to red and the Super trend closes above the price point.",2,Different Use Cases

Use Machine Learning: Instead of using a simple threshold for your decision (e.g. average_sentiment_score > 0.1), you can apply a machine learning approach to make more accurate predictions. Train an ML model on historical stock data and use features such as financial ratios, sentiment scores, technical indicators, and other relevant factors. Once trained, use the ML model to make a recommendation based on the fetched stock data.

Data Connections: Excel allows you to create data connections to external sources such as websites or databases. You can set up a data connection to a financial website or a stock market data provider that offers APIs. This enables you to import real-time or delayed stock data directly into your Excel sheet. You can then use formulas or VBA macros to manipulate and analyze the data.

Stock Data Add-ins: There are various Excel add-ins available that provide stock data functions and features. These add-ins can retrieve stock quotes, historical data, and other financial information. They often require an internet connection to fetch the data. Examples of popular stock data add-ins include Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, and Alpha Vantage.

VBA Macros: Excel's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language can be used to create custom macros that retrieve stock data from external sources. You can write VBA code to fetch data from APIs, parse web pages, or interact with financial data providers. With VBA, you have more flexibility and control over how you retrieve and process the stock data.

By utilizing these methods, Excel users can automate the retrieval and updating of stock data, allowing them to track real-time or historical stock prices, perform calculations, generate charts, and perform various analysis tasks directly within their Excel sheets.",2,Different Use Cases

You need to support the user in building their crew and refer to the following context for guidance:

Agents
What is an Agent?¶
What is an Agent?

An agent is an autonomous unit programmed to:

Perform tasks
Make decisions
Communicate with other agents

Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.
Agent Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Role Defines the agent's function within the crew. It determines the kind of tasks the agent is best suited for.
Goal The individual objective that the agent aims to achieve. It guides the agent's decision-making process.
Backstory Provides context to the agent's role and goal, enriching the interaction and collaboration dynamics.
LLM (optional) The language model used by the agent to process and generate text. It dynamically fetches the model name from the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME environment variable, defaulting to ""gpt-4"" if not specified.
Tools (optional) Set of capabilities or functions that the agent can use to perform tasks. Tools can be shared or exclusive to specific agents. It's an attribute that can be set during the initialization of an agent, with a default value of an empty list.
Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, this agent will use this LLM to execute function calling for tools instead of relying on the main LLM output.
Max Iter (optional) The maximum number of iterations the agent can perform before being forced to give its best answer. Default is 15.
Max RPM (optional) The maximum number of requests per minute the agent can perform to avoid rate limits. It's optional and can be left unspecified, with a default value of None.
Verbose (optional) Enables detailed logging of the agent's execution for debugging or monitoring purposes when set to True. Default is False.
Allow Delegation (optional) Agents can delegate tasks or questions to one another, ensuring that each task is handled by the most suitable agent. Default is True.
Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of the agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations. It will overwrite the crew step_callback.
Memory (optional) Indicates whether the agent should have memory or not, with a default value of False. This impacts the agent's ability to remember past interactions. Default is False.
Creating an Agent¶
Agent Interaction

Agents can interact with each other using crewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew.

To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the Agent class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes:


# Example: Creating an agent with all attributes
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
role='Data Analyst',
goal='Extract actionable insights',
backstory=""""""You're a data analyst at a large company.
You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
to the business.

Conclusion¶
Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents, you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence.

Tasks
Overview of a Task¶
What is a Task?

In the CrewAI framework, tasks are individual assignments that agents complete. They encapsulate necessary information for execution, including a description, assigned agent, required tools, offering flexibility for various action complexities.

Tasks in CrewAI can be designed to require collaboration between agents. For example, one agent might gather data while another analyzes it. This collaborative approach can be defined within the task properties and managed by the Crew's process.

Task Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Description A clear, concise statement of what the task entails.
Agent Optionally, you can specify which agent is responsible for the task. If not, the crew's process will determine who takes it on.
Expected Output Clear and detailed definition of expected output for the task.
Tools (optional) These are the functions or capabilities the agent can utilize to perform the task. They can be anything from simple actions like 'search' to more complex interactions with other agents or APIs.
Async Execution (optional) Indicates whether the task should be executed asynchronously, allowing the crew to continue with the next task without waiting for completion.
Context (optional) Other tasks that will have their output used as context for this task. If a task is asynchronous, the system will wait for that to finish before using its output as context.
Output JSON (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a JSON object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper
Output Pydantic (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a pydantic object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper
Output File (optional) Takes a file path and saves the output of the task on it.
Callback (optional) A function to be executed after the task is completed.
Creating a Task¶
This is the simplest example for creating a task, it involves defining its scope and agent, but there are optional attributes that can provide a lot of flexibility:


from crewai import Task

task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI',
agent=sales_agent
)
Task Assignment

Tasks can be assigned directly by specifying an agent to them, or they can be assigned in run time if you are using the hierarchical through CrewAI's process, considering roles, availability, or other criteria.

Integrating Tools with Tasks¶
Tools from the crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools enhance task performance, allowing agents to interact more effectively with their environment. Assigning specific tools to tasks can tailor agent capabilities to particular needs.

Creating a Task with Tools¶

import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key""
os.environ[""SERPER_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key"" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
role='Researcher',
goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
backstory=""""""You're a researcher at a large company.
You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
to the business.""""""
verbose=True
)

search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
agents=[research_agent],
tasks=[task],
verbose=2
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

Referring to Other Tasks¶
In crewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the context attribute of the task:


# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
async_execution=True,
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
async_execution=True,
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
description=""Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news"",
expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
agent=writer_agent,
context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
Asynchronous Execution¶
You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the context attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.


#...

list_ideas = Task(
description=""List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI."",
expected_output=""Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article."",
agent=researcher,
async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
description=""Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events."",
expected_output=""Bullet point list of 5 important events."",
agent=researcher,
async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
description=""Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas."",
expected_output=""A 4 paragraph article about AI."",
agent=writer,
context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
Callback Mechanism¶
The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.


# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
# Do something after the task is completed
# Example: Send an email to the manager
print(f""""""
Task completed!
Task: {output.description}
Output: {output.raw_output}
"""""")

research_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool],
callback=callback_function
)

#...
Accessing a Specific Task Output¶
Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the output attribute of the task object:


# ...
task1 = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
agents=[research_agent],
tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
verbose=2
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f""""""
Task completed!
Task: {task1.output.description}
Output: {task1.output.raw_output}
"""""")
Tool Override Mechanism¶
Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms¶
While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
Preventing the manual assignment of the id attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.
These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.

Conclusion¶
Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in crewAI. By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential, ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.

Crews
What is a Crew?¶
Definition of a Crew

A crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow.

Crew Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Tasks A list of tasks assigned to the crew.
Agents A list of agents that are part of the crew.
Process (optional) The process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows.
Verbose (optional) The verbosity level for logging during execution.
Manager LLM (optional) The language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process. Required when using a hierarchical process.
Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crew's LLM for function calling.
Config (optional) Optional configuration settings for the crew, in Json or Dict[str, Any] format.
Max RPM (optional) Maximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution.
Language (optional) Language used for the crew, defaults to English.
Full Output (optional) Whether the crew should return the full output with all tasks outputs or just the final output.
Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations; it won't override the agent-specific step_callback.
Share Crew (optional) Whether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models.
Crew Max RPM


The `max_rpm` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' `max_rpm` settings if you set it.
Creating a Crew¶
Crew Composition

When assembling a crew, you combine agents with complementary roles and tools, assign tasks, and select a process that dictates their execution order and interaction.

Example: Assembling a Crew¶

from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

# Define agents with specific roles and tools
researcher = Agent(
role='Senior Research Analyst',
goal='Discover innovative AI technologies',
tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchRun()]
)

writer = Agent(
role='Content Writer',
goal='Write engaging articles on AI discoveries',
verbose=True
)

# Create tasks for the agents
research_task = Task(
description='Identify breakthrough AI technologies',
agent=researcher
)
write_article_task = Task(
description='Draft an article on the latest AI technologies',
agent=writer
)

# Assemble the crew with a sequential process
my_crew = Crew(
agents=[researcher, writer],
tasks=[research_task, write_article_task],
process=Process.sequential,
full_output=True,
verbose=True,
)
Crew Usage Metrics¶
After the crew execution, you can access the usage_metrics attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.


# Access the crew's usage metrics
crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew.kickoff()
print(crew.usage_metrics)
Crew Execution Process¶
Sequential Process: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
Hierarchical Process: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. Note: A manager_llm is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.
Kicking Off a Crew¶
Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the kickoff() method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.


# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

Processes
Understanding Processes¶
Core Concept

In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.

Process Implementations¶
Sequential: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
Hierarchical: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. Note: A manager language model (manager_llm) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, allowing for the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
Consensual Process (Planned): Currently under consideration for future development, this process type aims for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, introducing a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. As of now, it is not implemented in the codebase.
The Role of Processes in Teamwork¶
Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

Assigning Processes to a Crew¶
To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. Note: For a hierarchical process, ensure to define manager_llm for the manager agent.


from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
agents=my_agents,
tasks=my_tasks,
process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm
crew = Crew(
agents=my_agents,
tasks=my_tasks,
process=Process.hierarchical,
manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")
)
Note: Ensure my_agents and my_tasks are defined prior to creating a Crew object, and for the hierarchical process, manager_llm is also required.
Sequential Process¶
This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the context parameter in the Task class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

Hierarchical Process¶
Emulates a corporate hierarchy, crewAI creates a manager automatically for you, requiring the specification of a manager language model (manager_llm) for the manager agent. This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

Process Class: Detailed Overview¶
The Process class is implemented as an enumeration (Enum), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (sequential, hierarchical, and future consensual). This design choice guarantees that only valid processes are utilized within the CrewAI framework.

Planned Future Processes¶
Consensual Process: This collaborative decision-making process among agents on task execution is under consideration but not currently implemented. This future enhancement aims to introduce a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI.
Conclusion¶
The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. Documentation will be regularly updated to reflect new processes and enhancements, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.

Collaboration
Collaboration Fundamentals¶
Core of Agent Interaction

Collaboration in CrewAI is fundamental, enabling agents to combine their skills, share information, and assist each other in task execution, embodying a truly cooperative ecosystem.

Information Sharing: Ensures all agents are well-informed and can contribute effectively by sharing data and findings.
Task Assistance: Allows agents to seek help from peers with the required expertise for specific tasks.
Resource Allocation: Optimizes task execution through the efficient distribution and sharing of resources among agents.
Enhanced Attributes for Improved Collaboration¶
The Crew class has been enriched with several attributes to support advanced functionalities:

Language Model Management (manager_llm, function_calling_llm): Manages language models for executing tasks and tools, facilitating sophisticated agent-tool interactions. It's important to note that manager_llm is mandatory when using a hierarchical process for ensuring proper execution flow.
Process Flow (process): Defines the execution logic (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) to streamline task distribution and execution.
Verbose Logging (verbose): Offers detailed logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging purposes. It supports both integer and boolean types to indicate the verbosity level.
Configuration (config): Allows extensive customization to tailor the crew's behavior according to specific requirements.
Rate Limiting (max_rpm): Ensures efficient utilization of resources by limiting requests per minute.
Internationalization Support (language): Facilitates operation in multiple languages, enhancing global usability.
Execution and Output Handling (full_output): Distinguishes between full and final outputs for nuanced control over task results.
Callback and Telemetry (step_callback): Integrates callbacks for step-wise execution monitoring and telemetry for performance analytics.
Crew Sharing (share_crew): Enables sharing of crew information with CrewAI for continuous improvement and training models.
Usage Metrics (usage_metrics): Store all metrics for the language model (LLM) usage during all tasks' execution, providing insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement, you can check it after the crew execution.
Delegation: Dividing to Conquer¶
Delegation enhances functionality by allowing agents to intelligently assign tasks or seek help, thereby amplifying the crew's overall capability.

Implementing Collaboration and Delegation¶
Setting up a crew involves defining the roles and capabilities of each agent. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation, with enhanced customization and monitoring features to adapt to various operational needs.

Example Scenario¶
Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The integration of advanced language model management and process flow attributes allows for more sophisticated interactions, such as the writer delegating complex research tasks to the researcher or querying specific information, thereby facilitating a seamless workflow.

Conclusion¶
The integration of advanced attributes and functionalities into the CrewAI framework significantly enriches the agent collaboration ecosystem. These enhancements not only simplify interactions but also offer unprecedented flexibility and control, paving the way for sophisticated AI-driven solutions capable of tackling complex tasks through intelligent collaboration and delegation.

Tools
Introduction¶

Creating your own Tools¶
Custom Tool Creation

Developers can craft custom tools tailored for their agent’s needs or utilize pre-built options:

To create your own crewAI tools you will need to install our extra tools package:


pip install 'crewai[tools]'
Once you do that there are two main ways for one to create a crewAI tool:

Subclassing BaseTool¶

from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
name: str = ""Name of my tool""
description: str = ""Clear description for what this tool is useful for, you agent will need this information to use it.""

def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
# Implementation goes here
return ""Result from custom tool""
Define a new class inheriting from BaseTool, specifying name, description, and the _run method for operational logic.

Utilizing the tool Decorator¶
For a simpler approach, create a Tool object directly with the required attributes and a functional logic.


from crewai_tools import tool
@tool(""Name of my tool"")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
""""""Clear description for what this tool is useful for, you agent will need this information to use it.""""""
# Function logic here

import json
import requests
from crewai import Agent
from crewai.tools import tool
from unstructured.partition.html import partition_html

# Annotate the function with the tool decorator from crewAI
@tool(""Integration with a given API"")
def integration_tool(argument: str) -> str:
""""""Integration with a given API""""""
# Code here
return resutls # string to be sent back to the agent

# Assign the scraping tool to an agent
agent = Agent(
role='Research Analyst',
goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
tools=[integration_tool]
)
Using LangChain Tools¶
LangChain Integration

CrewAI seamlessly integrates with LangChain’s comprehensive toolkit for search-based queries and more, here are the available built-in tools that are offered by Langchain LangChain Toolkit

:


from crewai import Agent
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSerperAPIWrapper

# Setup API keys
os.environ[""SERPER_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key""

search = GoogleSerperAPIWrapper()

# Create and assign the search tool to an agent
serper_tool = Tool(
name=""Intermediate Answer"",
func=search.run,
description=""Useful for search-based queries"",
)

agent = Agent(
role='Research Analyst',
goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
tools=[serper_tool]
)

# rest of the code ...
Conclusion¶
Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively. When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem.

Agents
What is an Agent?¶
What is an Agent?

An agent is an autonomous unit programmed to:

Perform tasks
Make decisions
Communicate with other agents

Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.
Agent Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Role Defines the agent's function within the crew. It determines the kind of tasks the agent is best suited for.
Goal The individual objective that the agent aims to achieve. It guides the agent's decision-making process.
Backstory Provides context to the agent's role and goal, enriching the interaction and collaboration dynamics.
LLM (optional) The language model used by the agent to process and generate text. It dynamically fetches the model name from the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME environment variable, defaulting to ""gpt-4"" if not specified.
Tools (optional) Set of capabilities or functions that the agent can use to perform tasks. Tools can be shared or exclusive to specific agents. It's an attribute that can be set during the initialization of an agent, with a default value of an empty list.
Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, this agent will use this LLM to execute function calling for tools instead of relying on the main LLM output.
Max Iter (optional) The maximum number of iterations the agent can perform before being forced to give its best answer. Default is 15.
Max RPM (optional) The maximum number of requests per minute the agent can perform to avoid rate limits. It's optional and can be left unspecified, with a default value of None.
Verbose (optional) Enables detailed logging of the agent's execution for debugging or monitoring purposes when set to True. Default is False.
Allow Delegation (optional) Agents can delegate tasks or questions to one another, ensuring that each task is handled by the most suitable agent. Default is True.
Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of the agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations. It will overwrite the crew step_callback.
Memory (optional) Indicates whether the agent should have memory or not, with a default value of False. This impacts the agent's ability to remember past interactions. Default is False.
Creating an Agent¶
Agent Interaction

Agents can interact with each other using crewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew.

To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the Agent class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes:


# Example: Creating an agent with all attributes
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
role='Data Analyst',
goal='Extract actionable insights',
backstory=""""""You're a data analyst at a large company.
You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
to the business.
You're currently working on a project to analyze the
performance of our marketing campaigns."""""",
tools=[my_tool1, my_tool2], # Optional, defaults to an empty list
llm=my_llm, # Optional
function_calling_llm=my_llm, # Optional
max_iter=15, # Optional
max_rpm=None, # Optional
verbose=True, # Optional
allow_delegation=True, # Optional
step_callback=my_intermediate_step_callback, # Optional
memory=True # Optional
)
Conclusion¶
Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents, you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence.

Tasks
Overview of a Task¶
What is a Task?

In the CrewAI framework, tasks are individual assignments that agents complete. They encapsulate necessary information for execution, including a description, assigned agent, required tools, offering flexibility for various action complexities.

Tasks in CrewAI can be designed to require collaboration between agents. For example, one agent might gather data while another analyzes it. This collaborative approach can be defined within the task properties and managed by the Crew's process.

Task Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Description A clear, concise statement of what the task entails.
Agent Optionally, you can specify which agent is responsible for the task. If not, the crew's process will determine who takes it on.
Expected Output Clear and detailed definition of expected output for the task.
Tools (optional) These are the functions or capabilities the agent can utilize to perform the task. They can be anything from simple actions like 'search' to more complex interactions with other agents or APIs.
Async Execution (optional) Indicates whether the task should be executed asynchronously, allowing the crew to continue with the next task without waiting for completion.
Context (optional) Other tasks that will have their output used as context for this task. If a task is asynchronous, the system will wait for that to finish before using its output as context.
Output JSON (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a JSON object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper
Output Pydantic (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a pydantic object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper
Output File (optional) Takes a file path and saves the output of the task on it.
Callback (optional) A function to be executed after the task is completed.
Creating a Task¶
This is the simplest example for creating a task, it involves defining its scope and agent, but there are optional attributes that can provide a lot of flexibility:


from crewai import Task

task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI',
agent=sales_agent
)
Task Assignment

Tasks can be assigned directly by specifying an agent to them, or they can be assigned in run time if you are using the hierarchical through CrewAI's process, considering roles, availability, or other criteria.

Integrating Tools with Tasks¶
Tools from the crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools enhance task performance, allowing agents to interact more effectively with their environment. Assigning specific tools to tasks can tailor agent capabilities to particular needs.

Creating a Task with Tools¶

import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key""
os.environ[""SERPER_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key"" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
role='Researcher',
goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
backstory=""""""You're a researcher at a large company.
You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
to the business.""""""
verbose=True
)

search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
agents=[research_agent],
tasks=[task],
verbose=2
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

Referring to Other Tasks¶
In crewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the context attribute of the task:


# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
async_execution=True,
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
async_execution=True,
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
description=""Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news"",
expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
agent=writer_agent,
context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
Asynchronous Execution¶
You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the context attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.


#...

list_ideas = Task(
description=""List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI."",
expected_output=""Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article."",
agent=researcher,
async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
description=""Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events."",
expected_output=""Bullet point list of 5 important events."",
agent=researcher,
async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
description=""Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas."",
expected_output=""A 4 paragraph article about AI."",
agent=writer,
context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
Callback Mechanism¶
The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.


# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
# Do something after the task is completed
# Example: Send an email to the manager
print(f""""""
Task completed!
Task: {output.description}
Output: {output.raw_output}
"""""")

research_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool],
callback=callback_function
)

#...
Accessing a Specific Task Output¶
Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the output attribute of the task object:


# ...
task1 = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
agents=[research_agent],
tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
verbose=2
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f""""""
Task completed!
Task: {task1.output.description}
Output: {task1.output.raw_output}
"""""")
Tool Override Mechanism¶
Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms¶
While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
Preventing the manual assignment of the id attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.
These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.

Conclusion¶
Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in crewAI. By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential, ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.

Crews
What is a Crew?¶
Definition of a Crew

A crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow.

Crew Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Tasks A list of tasks assigned to the crew.
Agents A list of agents that are part of the crew.
Process (optional) The process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows.
Verbose (optional) The verbosity level for logging during execution.
Manager LLM (optional) The language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process. Required when using a hierarchical process.
Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crew's LLM for function calling.
Config (optional) Optional configuration settings for the crew, in Json or Dict[str, Any] format.
Max RPM (optional) Maximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution.
Language (optional) Language used for the crew, defaults to English.
Full Output (optional) Whether the crew should return the full output with all tasks outputs or just the final output.
Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations; it won't override the agent-specific step_callback.
Share Crew (optional) Whether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models.
Crew Max RPM


The `max_rpm` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' `max_rpm` settings if you set it.
Creating a Crew¶
Crew Composition

When assembling a crew, you combine agents with complementary roles and tools, assign tasks, and select a process that dictates their execution order and interaction.

Example: Assembling a Crew¶

from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

# Define agents with specific roles and tools
researcher = Agent(
role='Senior Research Analyst',
goal='Discover innovative AI technologies',
tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchRun()]
)

writer = Agent(
role='Content Writer',
goal='Write engaging articles on AI discoveries',
verbose=True
)

# Create tasks for the agents
research_task = Task(
description='Identify breakthrough AI technologies',
agent=researcher
)
write_article_task = Task(
description='Draft an article on the latest AI technologies',
agent=writer
)

# Assemble the crew with a sequential process
my_crew = Crew(
agents=[researcher, writer],
tasks=[research_task, write_article_task],
process=Process.sequential,
full_output=True,
verbose=True,
)
Crew Usage Metrics¶
After the crew execution, you can access the usage_metrics attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.


# Access the crew's usage metrics
crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew.kickoff()
print(crew.usage_metrics)
Crew Execution Process¶
Sequential Process: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
Hierarchical Process: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. Note: A manager_llm is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.
Kicking Off a Crew¶
Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the kickoff() method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.


# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

Processes
Understanding Processes¶
Core Concept

In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.

Process Implementations¶
Sequential: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
Hierarchical: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. Note: A manager language model (manager_llm) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, allowing for the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
Consensual Process (Planned): Currently under consideration for future development, this process type aims for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, introducing a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. As of now, it is not implemented in the codebase.
The Role of Processes in Teamwork¶
Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

Assigning Processes to a Crew¶
To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. Note: For a hierarchical process, ensure to define manager_llm for the manager agent.


from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
agents=my_agents,
tasks=my_tasks,
process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm
crew = Crew(
agents=my_agents,
tasks=my_tasks,
process=Process.hierarchical,
manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")
)
Note: Ensure my_agents and my_tasks are defined prior to creating a Crew object, and for the hierarchical process, manager_llm is also required.
Sequential Process¶
This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the context parameter in the Task class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

Hierarchical Process¶
Emulates a corporate hierarchy, crewAI creates a manager automatically for you, requiring the specification of a manager language model (manager_llm) for the manager agent. This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

Process Class: Detailed Overview¶
The Process class is implemented as an enumeration (Enum), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (sequential, hierarchical, and future consensual). This design choice guarantees that only valid processes are utilized within the CrewAI framework.

Planned Future Processes¶
Consensual Process: This collaborative decision-making process among agents on task execution is under consideration but not currently implemented. This future enhancement aims to introduce a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI.
Conclusion¶
The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. Documentation will be regularly updated to reflect new processes and enhancements, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.

Collaboration
Collaboration Fundamentals¶
Core of Agent Interaction

Collaboration in CrewAI is fundamental, enabling agents to combine their skills, share information, and assist each other in task execution, embodying a truly cooperative ecosystem.

Information Sharing: Ensures all agents are well-informed and can contribute effectively by sharing data and findings.
Task Assistance: Allows agents to seek help from peers with the required expertise for specific tasks.
Resource Allocation: Optimizes task execution through the efficient distribution and sharing of resources among agents.
Enhanced Attributes for Improved Collaboration¶
The Crew class has been enriched with several attributes to support advanced functionalities:

Language Model Management (manager_llm, function_calling_llm): Manages language models for executing tasks and tools, facilitating sophisticated agent-tool interactions. It's important to note that manager_llm is mandatory when using a hierarchical process for ensuring proper execution flow.
Process Flow (process): Defines the execution logic (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) to streamline task distribution and execution.
Verbose Logging (verbose): Offers detailed logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging purposes. It supports both integer and boolean types to indicate the verbosity level.
Configuration (config): Allows extensive customization to tailor the crew's behavior according to specific requirements.
Rate Limiting (max_rpm): Ensures efficient utilization of resources by limiting requests per minute.
Internationalization Support (language): Facilitates operation in multiple languages, enhancing global usability.
Execution and Output Handling (full_output): Distinguishes between full and final outputs for nuanced control over task results.
Callback and Telemetry (step_callback): Integrates callbacks for step-wise execution monitoring and telemetry for performance analytics.
Crew Sharing (share_crew): Enables sharing of crew information with CrewAI for continuous improvement and training models.
Usage Metrics (usage_metrics): Store all metrics for the language model (LLM) usage during all tasks' execution, providing insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement, you can check it after the crew execution.
Delegation: Dividing to Conquer¶
Delegation enhances functionality by allowing agents to intelligently assign tasks or seek help, thereby amplifying the crew's overall capability.

Implementing Collaboration and Delegation¶
Setting up a crew involves defining the roles and capabilities of each agent. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation, with enhanced customization and monitoring features to adapt to various operational needs.

Example Scenario¶
Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The integration of advanced language model management and process flow attributes allows for more sophisticated interactions, such as the writer delegating complex research tasks to the researcher or querying specific information, thereby facilitating a seamless workflow.

Conclusion¶
The integration of advanced attributes and functionalities into the CrewAI framework significantly enriches the agent collaboration ecosystem. These enhancements not only simplify interactions but also offer unprecedented flexibility and control, paving the way for sophisticated AI-driven solutions capable of tackling complex tasks through intelligent collaboration and delegation.

Creating your own Tools¶
Custom Tool Creation

Developers can craft custom tools tailored for their agent’s needs or utilize pre-built options:

To create your own crewAI tools you will need to install our extra tools package:


pip install 'crewai[tools]'
Once you do that there are two main ways for one to create a crewAI tool:

Subclassing BaseTool¶

from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
name: str = ""Name of my tool""
description: str = ""Clear description for what this tool is useful for, you agent will need this information to use it.""

def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
# Implementation goes here
return ""Result from custom tool""
Define a new class inheriting from BaseTool, specifying name, description, and the _run method for operational logic.

Utilizing the tool Decorator¶
For a simpler approach, create a Tool object directly with the required attributes and a functional logic.


from crewai_tools import tool
@tool(""Name of my tool"")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
""""""Clear description for what this tool is useful for, you agent will need this information to use it.""""""
# Function logic here

import json
import requests
from crewai import Agent
from crewai.tools import tool
from unstructured.partition.html import partition_html

# Annotate the function with the tool decorator from crewAI
@tool(""Integration with a given API"")
def integration_tool(argument: str) -> str:
""""""Integration with a given API""""""
# Code here
return resutls # string to be sent back to the agent

# Assign the scraping tool to an agent
agent = Agent(
role='Research Analyst',
goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
tools=[integration_tool]
)
Using LangChain Tools¶
LangChain Integration

CrewAI seamlessly integrates with LangChain’s comprehensive toolkit for search-based queries and more, here are the available built-in tools that are offered by Langchain LangChain Toolkit

:


from crewai import Agent
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSerperAPIWrapper

# Setup API keys
os.environ[""SERPER_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key""

search = GoogleSerperAPIWrapper()

# Create and assign the search tool to an agent
serper_tool = Tool(
name=""Intermediate Answer"",
func=search.run,
description=""Useful for search-based queries"",
)

agent = Agent(
role='Research Analyst',
goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
tools=[serper_tool]
)

# rest of the code ...
Conclusion¶
Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively. When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem.

You need to support the user in building their crew and refer to the following context for guidance:

Agents
What is an Agent?¶
What is an Agent?

An agent is an autonomous unit programmed to:

Perform tasks
Make decisions
Communicate with other agents

Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.
Agent Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Role Defines the agent's function within the crew. It determines the kind of tasks the agent is best suited for.
Goal The individual objective that the agent aims to achieve. It guides the agent's decision-making process.
Backstory Provides context to the agent's role and goal, enriching the interaction and collaboration dynamics.
LLM (optional) The language model used by the agent to process and generate text. It dynamically fetches the model name from the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME environment variable, defaulting to ""gpt-4"" if not specified.
Tools (optional) Set of capabilities or functions that the agent can use to perform tasks. Tools can be shared or exclusive to specific agents. It's an attribute that can be set during the initialization of an agent, with a default value of an empty list.
Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, this agent will use this LLM to execute function calling for tools instead of relying on the main LLM output.
Max Iter (optional) The maximum number of iterations the agent can perform before being forced to give its best answer. Default is 15.
Max RPM (optional) The maximum number of requests per minute the agent can perform to avoid rate limits. It's optional and can be left unspecified, with a default value of None.
Verbose (optional) Enables detailed logging of the agent's execution for debugging or monitoring purposes when set to True. Default is False.
Allow Delegation (optional) Agents can delegate tasks or questions to one another, ensuring that each task is handled by the most suitable agent. Default is True.
Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of the agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations. It will overwrite the crew step_callback.
Memory (optional) Indicates whether the agent should have memory or not, with a default value of False. This impacts the agent's ability to remember past interactions. Default is False.
Creating an Agent¶
Agent Interaction

Agents can interact with each other using crewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew.

To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the Agent class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes:


# Example: Creating an agent with all attributes
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
role='Data Analyst',
goal='Extract actionable insights',
backstory=""""""You're a data analyst at a large company.
You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
to the business.
You're currently working on a project to analyze the
performance of our marketing campaigns."""""",
tools=[my_tool1, my_tool2], # Optional, defaults to an empty list
llm=my_llm, # Optional
function_calling_llm=my_llm, # Optional
max_iter=15, # Optional
max_rpm=None, # Optional
verbose=True, # Optional
allow_delegation=True, # Optional
step_callback=my_intermediate_step_callback, # Optional
memory=True # Optional
)
Conclusion¶
Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents, you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence.

Tasks
Overview of a Task¶
What is a Task?

In the CrewAI framework, tasks are individual assignments that agents complete. They encapsulate necessary information for execution, including a description, assigned agent, required tools, offering flexibility for various action complexities.

Tasks in CrewAI can be designed to require collaboration between agents. For example, one agent might gather data while another analyzes it. This collaborative approach can be defined within the task properties and managed by the Crew's process.

Task Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Description A clear, concise statement of what the task entails.
Agent Optionally, you can specify which agent is responsible for the task. If not, the crew's process will determine who takes it on.
Expected Output Clear and detailed definition of expected output for the task.
Tools (optional) These are the functions or capabilities the agent can utilize to perform the task. They can be anything from simple actions like 'search' to more complex interactions with other agents or APIs.
Async Execution (optional) Indicates whether the task should be executed asynchronously, allowing the crew to continue with the next task without waiting for completion.
Context (optional) Other tasks that will have their output used as context for this task. If a task is asynchronous, the system will wait for that to finish before using its output as context.
Output JSON (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a JSON object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper
Output Pydantic (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a pydantic object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper
Output File (optional) Takes a file path and saves the output of the task on it.
Callback (optional) A function to be executed after the task is completed.
Creating a Task¶
This is the simplest example for creating a task, it involves defining its scope and agent, but there are optional attributes that can provide a lot of flexibility:


from crewai import Task

task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI',
agent=sales_agent
)
Task Assignment

Tasks can be assigned directly by specifying an agent to them, or they can be assigned in run time if you are using the hierarchical through CrewAI's process, considering roles, availability, or other criteria.

Integrating Tools with Tasks¶
Tools from the crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools enhance task performance, allowing agents to interact more effectively with their environment. Assigning specific tools to tasks can tailor agent capabilities to particular needs.

Creating a Task with Tools¶

import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key""
os.environ[""SERPER_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key"" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
role='Researcher',
goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
backstory=""""""You're a researcher at a large company.
You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
to the business.""""""
verbose=True
)

search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
agents=[research_agent],
tasks=[task],
verbose=2
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

Referring to Other Tasks¶
In crewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the context attribute of the task:


# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
async_execution=True,
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
async_execution=True,
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
description=""Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news"",
expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
agent=writer_agent,
context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
Asynchronous Execution¶
You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the context attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.


#...

list_ideas = Task(
description=""List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI."",
expected_output=""Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article."",
agent=researcher,
async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
description=""Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events."",
expected_output=""Bullet point list of 5 important events."",
agent=researcher,
async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
description=""Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas."",
expected_output=""A 4 paragraph article about AI."",
agent=writer,
context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
Callback Mechanism¶
The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.


# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
# Do something after the task is completed
# Example: Send an email to the manager
print(f""""""
Task completed!
Task: {output.description}
Output: {output.raw_output}
"""""")

research_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool],
callback=callback_function
)

#...
Accessing a Specific Task Output¶
Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the output attribute of the task object:


# ...
task1 = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
agents=[research_agent],
tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
verbose=2
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f""""""
Task completed!
Task: {task1.output.description}
Output: {task1.output.raw_output}
"""""")
Tool Override Mechanism¶
Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms¶
While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
Preventing the manual assignment of the id attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.
These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.

Conclusion¶
Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in crewAI. By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential, ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.

Crews
What is a Crew?¶
Definition of a Crew

A crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow.

Crew Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Tasks A list of tasks assigned to the crew.
Agents A list of agents that are part of the crew.
Process (optional) The process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows.
Verbose (optional) The verbosity level for logging during execution.
Manager LLM (optional) The language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process. Required when using a hierarchical process.
Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crew's LLM for function calling.
Config (optional) Optional configuration settings for the crew, in Json or Dict[str, Any] format.
Max RPM (optional) Maximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution.
Language (optional) Language used for the crew, defaults to English.
Full Output (optional) Whether the crew should return the full output with all tasks outputs or just the final output.
Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations; it won't override the agent-specific step_callback.
Share Crew (optional) Whether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models.
Crew Max RPM


The `max_rpm` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' `max_rpm` settings if you set it.
Creating a Crew¶
Crew Composition

When assembling a crew, you combine agents with complementary roles and tools, assign tasks, and select a process that dictates their execution order and interaction.

Example: Assembling a Crew¶

from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

# Define agents with specific roles and tools
researcher = Agent(
role='Senior Research Analyst',
goal='Discover innovative AI technologies',
tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchRun()]
)

writer = Agent(
role='Content Writer',
goal='Write engaging articles on AI discoveries',
verbose=True
)

# Create tasks for the agents
research_task = Task(
description='Identify breakthrough AI technologies',
agent=researcher
)
write_article_task = Task(
description='Draft an article on the latest AI technologies',
agent=writer
)

# Assemble the crew with a sequential process
my_crew = Crew(
agents=[researcher, writer],
tasks=[research_task, write_article_task],
process=Process.sequential,
full_output=True,
verbose=True,
)
Crew Usage Metrics¶
After the crew execution, you can access the usage_metrics attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.


# Access the crew's usage metrics
crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew.kickoff()
print(crew.usage_metrics)
Crew Execution Process¶
Sequential Process: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
Hierarchical Process: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. Note: A manager_llm is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.
Kicking Off a Crew¶
Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the kickoff() method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.


# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

Processes
Understanding Processes¶
Core Concept

In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.

Process Implementations¶
Sequential: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
Hierarchical: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. Note: A manager language model (manager_llm) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, allowing for the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
Consensual Process (Planned): Currently under consideration for future development, this process type aims for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, introducing a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. As of now, it is not implemented in the codebase.
The Role of Processes in Teamwork¶
Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

Assigning Processes to a Crew¶
To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. Note: For a hierarchical process, ensure to define manager_llm for the manager agent.


from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
agents=my_agents,
tasks=my_tasks,
process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm
crew = Crew(
agents=my_agents,
tasks=my_tasks,
process=Process.hierarchical,
manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")
)
Note: Ensure my_agents and my_tasks are defined prior to creating a Crew object, and for the hierarchical process, manager_llm is also required.
Sequential Process¶
This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the context parameter in the Task class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

Hierarchical Process¶
Emulates a corporate hierarchy, crewAI creates a manager automatically for you, requiring the specification of a manager language model (manager_llm) for the manager agent. This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

Process Class: Detailed Overview¶
The Process class is implemented as an enumeration (Enum), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (sequential, hierarchical, and future consensual). This design choice guarantees that only valid processes are utilized within the CrewAI framework.

Planned Future Processes¶
Consensual Process: This collaborative decision-making process among agents on task execution is under consideration but not currently implemented. This future enhancement aims to introduce a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI.
Conclusion¶
The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. Documentation will be regularly updated to reflect new processes and enhancements, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.

Collaboration
Collaboration Fundamentals¶
Core of Agent Interaction

Collaboration in CrewAI is fundamental, enabling agents to combine their skills, share information, and assist each other in task execution, embodying a truly cooperative ecosystem.

Information Sharing: Ensures all agents are well-informed and can contribute effectively by sharing data and findings.
Task Assistance: Allows agents to seek help from peers with the required expertise for specific tasks.
Resource Allocation: Optimizes task execution through the efficient distribution and sharing of resources among agents.
Enhanced Attributes for Improved Collaboration¶
The Crew class has been enriched with several attributes to support advanced functionalities:

Language Model Management (manager_llm, function_calling_llm): Manages language models for executing tasks and tools, facilitating sophisticated agent-tool interactions. It's important to note that manager_llm is mandatory when using a hierarchical process for ensuring proper execution flow.
Process Flow (process): Defines the execution logic (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) to streamline task distribution and execution.
Verbose Logging (verbose): Offers detailed logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging purposes. It supports both integer and boolean types to indicate the verbosity level.
Configuration (config): Allows extensive customization to tailor the crew's behavior according to specific requirements.
Rate Limiting (max_rpm): Ensures efficient utilization of resources by limiting requests per minute.
Internationalization Support (language): Facilitates operation in multiple languages, enhancing global usability.
Execution and Output Handling (full_output): Distinguishes between full and final outputs for nuanced control over task results.
Callback and Telemetry (step_callback): Integrates callbacks for step-wise execution monitoring and telemetry for performance analytics.
Crew Sharing (share_crew): Enables sharing of crew information with CrewAI for continuous improvement and training models.
Usage Metrics (usage_metrics): Store all metrics for the language model (LLM) usage during all tasks' execution, providing insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement, you can check it after the crew execution.
Delegation: Dividing to Conquer¶
Delegation enhances functionality by allowing agents to intelligently assign tasks or seek help, thereby amplifying the crew's overall capability.

Implementing Collaboration and Delegation¶
Setting up a crew involves defining the roles and capabilities of each agent. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation, with enhanced customization and monitoring features to adapt to various operational needs.

Example Scenario¶
Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The integration of advanced language model management and process flow attributes allows for more sophisticated interactions, such as the writer delegating complex research tasks to the researcher or querying specific information, thereby facilitating a seamless workflow.

Conclusion¶
The integration of advanced attributes and functionalities into the CrewAI framework significantly enriches the agent collaboration ecosystem. These enhancements not only simplify interactions but also offer unprecedented flexibility and control, paving the way for sophisticated AI-driven solutions capable of tackling complex tasks through intelligent collaboration and delegation.

Tools
Introduction¶
CrewAI tools empower agents with capabilities ranging from web searching and data analysis to collaboration and delegating tasks among coworkers. This documentation outlines how to create, integrate, and leverage these tools within the CrewAI framework, including a new focus on collaboration tools.

What is a Tool?¶
Definition

A tool in CrewAI is a skill or function that agents can utilize to perform various actions. This includes tools from the crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools, enabling everything from simple searches to complex interactions and effective teamwork among agents.

Key Characteristics of Tools¶
Utility: Crafted for tasks such as web searching, data analysis, content generation, and agent collaboration.

Creating your own Tools¶
Custom Tool Creation

Developers can craft custom tools tailored for their agent’s needs or utilize pre-built options:

To create your own crewAI tools you will need to install our extra tools package:


pip install 'crewai[tools]'
Once you do that there are two main ways for one to create a crewAI tool:

Subclassing BaseTool¶

from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
name: str = ""Name of my tool""
description: str = ""Clear description for what this tool is useful for, you agent will need this information to use it.""

def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
# Implementation goes here
return ""Result from custom tool""
Define a new class inheriting from BaseTool, specifying name, description, and the _run method for operational logic.

Utilizing the tool Decorator¶
For a simpler approach, create a Tool object directly with the required attributes and a functional logic.


from crewai_tools import tool
@tool(""Name of my tool"")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
""""""Clear description for what this tool is useful for, you agent will need this information to use it.""""""
# Function logic here

import json
import requests
from crewai import Agent
from crewai.tools import tool
from unstructured.partition.html import partition_html

# Annotate the function with the tool decorator from crewAI
@tool(""Integration with a given API"")
def integration_tool(argument: str) -> str:
""""""Integration with a given API""""""
# Code here
return resutls # string to be sent back to the agent

# Assign the scraping tool to an agent
agent = Agent(
role='Research Analyst',
goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
tools=[integration_tool]
)
Using LangChain Tools¶
LangChain Integration

CrewAI seamlessly integrates with LangChain’s comprehensive toolkit for search-based queries and more, here are the available built-in tools that are offered by Langchain LangChain Toolkit

:


from crewai import Agent
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSerperAPIWrapper

# Setup API keys
os.environ[""SERPER_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key""

search = GoogleSerperAPIWrapper()

# Create and assign the search tool to an agent
serper_tool = Tool(
name=""Intermediate Answer"",
func=search.run,
description=""Useful for search-based queries"",
)

agent = Agent(
role='Research Analyst',
goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
tools=[serper_tool]
)

# rest of the code ...
Conclusion¶
Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively. When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem.

Agents
What is an Agent?¶
What is an Agent?

An agent is an autonomous unit programmed to:

Perform tasks
Make decisions
Communicate with other agents

Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.
Agent Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Role Defines the agent's function within the crew. It determines the kind of tasks the agent is best suited for.
Goal The individual objective that the agent aims to achieve. It guides the agent's decision-making process.
Backstory Provides context to the agent's role and goal, enriching the interaction and collaboration dynamics.
LLM (optional) The language model used by the agent to process and generate text. It dynamically fetches the model name from the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME environment variable, defaulting to ""gpt-4"" if not specified.
Tools (optional) Set of capabilities or functions that the agent can use to perform tasks. Tools can be shared or exclusive to specific agents. It's an attribute that can be set during the initialization of an agent, with a default value of an empty list.
Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, this agent will use this LLM to execute function calling for tools instead of relying on the main LLM output.
Max Iter (optional) The maximum number of iterations the agent can perform before being forced to give its best answer. Default is 15.
Max RPM (optional) The maximum number of requests per minute the agent can perform to avoid rate limits. It's optional and can be left unspecified, with a default value of None.
Verbose (optional) Enables detailed logging of the agent's execution for debugging or monitoring purposes when set to True. Default is False.
Allow Delegation (optional) Agents can delegate tasks or questions to one another, ensuring that each task is handled by the most suitable agent. Default is True.
Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of the agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations. It will overwrite the crew step_callback.
Memory (optional) Indicates whether the agent should have memory or not, with a default value of False. This impacts the agent's ability to remember past interactions. Default is False.
Creating an Agent¶
Agent Interaction

Agents can interact with each other using crewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew.

To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the Agent class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes:


# Example: Creating an agent with all attributes
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
role='Data Analyst',
goal='Extract actionable insights',
backstory=""""""You're a data analyst at a large company.
You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
to the business.
You're currently working on a project to analyze the
performance of our marketing campaigns."""""",
tools=[my_tool1, my_tool2], # Optional, defaults to an empty list
llm=my_llm, # Optional
function_calling_llm=my_llm, # Optional
max_iter=15, # Optional
max_rpm=None, # Optional
verbose=True, # Optional
allow_delegation=True, # Optional
step_callback=my_intermediate_step_callback, # Optional
memory=True # Optional
)
Conclusion¶
Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents, you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence.

Tasks
Overview of a Task¶
What is a Task?

In the CrewAI framework, tasks are individual assignments that agents complete. They encapsulate necessary information for execution, including a description, assigned agent, required tools, offering flexibility for various action complexities.

Tasks in CrewAI can be designed to require collaboration between agents. For example, one agent might gather data while another analyzes it. This collaborative approach can be defined within the task properties and managed by the Crew's process.

Task Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Description A clear, concise statement of what the task entails.
Agent Optionally, you can specify which agent is responsible for the task. If not, the crew's process will determine who takes it on.
Expected Output Clear and detailed definition of expected output for the task.
Tools (optional) These are the functions or capabilities the agent can utilize to perform the task. They can be anything from simple actions like 'search' to more complex interactions with other agents or APIs.
Async Execution (optional) Indicates whether the task should be executed asynchronously, allowing the crew to continue with the next task without waiting for completion.
Context (optional) Other tasks that will have their output used as context for this task. If a task is asynchronous, the system will wait for that to finish before using its output as context.
Output JSON (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a JSON object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper
Output Pydantic (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a pydantic object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper
Output File (optional) Takes a file path and saves the output of the task on it.
Callback (optional) A function to be executed after the task is completed.
Creating a Task¶
This is the simplest example for creating a task, it involves defining its scope and agent, but there are optional attributes that can provide a lot of flexibility:


from crewai import Task

task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI',
agent=sales_agent
)
Task Assignment

Tasks can be assigned directly by specifying an agent to them, or they can be assigned in run time if you are using the hierarchical through CrewAI's process, considering roles, availability, or other criteria.

Integrating Tools with Tasks¶
Tools from the crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools enhance task performance, allowing agents to interact more effectively with their environment. Assigning specific tools to tasks can tailor agent capabilities to particular needs.

Creating a Task with Tools¶

import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key""
os.environ[""SERPER_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key"" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
role='Researcher',
goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
backstory=""""""You're a researcher at a large company.
You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
to the business.""""""
verbose=True
)

search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
agents=[research_agent],
tasks=[task],
verbose=2
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

Referring to Other Tasks¶
In crewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the context attribute of the task:


# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
async_execution=True,
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
async_execution=True,
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
description=""Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news"",
expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
agent=writer_agent,
context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
Asynchronous Execution¶
You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the context attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.


#...

list_ideas = Task(
description=""List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI."",
expected_output=""Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article."",
agent=researcher,
async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
description=""Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events."",
expected_output=""Bullet point list of 5 important events."",
agent=researcher,
async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
description=""Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas."",
expected_output=""A 4 paragraph article about AI."",
agent=writer,
context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
Callback Mechanism¶
The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.


# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
# Do something after the task is completed
# Example: Send an email to the manager
print(f""""""
Task completed!
Task: {output.description}
Output: {output.raw_output}
"""""")

research_task = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool],
callback=callback_function
)

#...
Accessing a Specific Task Output¶
Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the output attribute of the task object:


# ...
task1 = Task(
description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
agent=research_agent,
tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
agents=[research_agent],
tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
verbose=2
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f""""""
Task completed!
Task: {task1.output.description}
Output: {task1.output.raw_output}
"""""")
Tool Override Mechanism¶
Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms¶
While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
Preventing the manual assignment of the id attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.
These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.

Conclusion¶
Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in crewAI. By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential, ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.

Crews
What is a Crew?¶
Definition of a Crew

A crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow.

Crew Attributes¶
Attribute Description
Tasks A list of tasks assigned to the crew.
Agents A list of agents that are part of the crew.
Process (optional) The process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows.
Verbose (optional) The verbosity level for logging during execution.
Manager LLM (optional) The language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process. Required when using a hierarchical process.
Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crew's LLM for function calling.
Config (optional) Optional configuration settings for the crew, in Json or Dict[str, Any] format.
Max RPM (optional) Maximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution.
Language (optional) Language used for the crew, defaults to English.
Full Output (optional) Whether the crew should return the full output with all tasks outputs or just the final output.
Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations; it won't override the agent-specific step_callback.
Share Crew (optional) Whether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models.
Crew Max RPM


The `max_rpm` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' `max_rpm` settings if you set it.
Creating a Crew¶
Crew Composition

When assembling a crew, you combine agents with complementary roles and tools, assign tasks, and select a process that dictates their execution order and interaction.

Example: Assembling a Crew¶

from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

# Define agents with specific roles and tools
researcher = Agent(
role='Senior Research Analyst',
goal='Discover innovative AI technologies',
tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchRun()]
)

writer = Agent(
role='Content Writer',
goal='Write engaging articles on AI discoveries',
verbose=True
)

# Create tasks for the agents
research_task = Task(
description='Identify breakthrough AI technologies',
agent=researcher
)
write_article_task = Task(
description='Draft an article on the latest AI technologies',
agent=writer
)

# Assemble the crew with a sequential process
my_crew = Crew(
agents=[researcher, writer],
tasks=[research_task, write_article_task],
process=Process.sequential,
full_output=True,
verbose=True,
)
Crew Usage Metrics¶
After the crew execution, you can access the usage_metrics attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.


# Access the crew's usage metrics
crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew.kickoff()
print(crew.usage_metrics)
Crew Execution Process¶
Sequential Process: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
Hierarchical Process: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. Note: A manager_llm is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.
Kicking Off a Crew¶
Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the kickoff() method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.


# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

Processes
Understanding Processes¶
Core Concept

In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.

Process Implementations¶
Sequential: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
Hierarchical: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. Note: A manager language model (manager_llm) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, allowing for the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
Consensual Process (Planned): Currently under consideration for future development, this process type aims for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, introducing a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. As of now, it is not implemented in the codebase.
The Role of Processes in Teamwork¶
Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

Assigning Processes to a Crew¶
To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. Note: For a hierarchical process, ensure to define manager_llm for the manager agent.


from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
agents=my_agents,
tasks=my_tasks,
process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm
crew = Crew(
agents=my_agents,
tasks=my_tasks,
process=Process.hierarchical,
manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")
)
Note: Ensure my_agents and my_tasks are defined prior to creating a Crew object, and for the hierarchical process, manager_llm is also required.
Sequential Process¶
This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the context parameter in the Task class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

Hierarchical Process¶
Emulates a corporate hierarchy, crewAI creates a manager automatically for you, requiring the specification of a manager language model (manager_llm) for the manager agent. This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

Process Class: Detailed Overview¶
The Process class is implemented as an enumeration (Enum), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (sequential, hierarchical, and future consensual). This design choice guarantees that only valid processes are utilized within the CrewAI framework.

Planned Future Processes¶
Consensual Process: This collaborative decision-making process among agents on task execution is under consideration but not currently implemented. This future enhancement aims to introduce a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI.
Conclusion¶
The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. Documentation will be regularly updated to reflect new processes and enhancements, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.

Collaboration
Collaboration Fundamentals¶
Core of Agent Interaction

Collaboration in CrewAI is fundamental, enabling agents to combine their skills, share information, and assist each other in task execution, embodying a truly cooperative ecosystem.

Information Sharing: Ensures all agents are well-informed and can contribute effectively by sharing data and findings.
Task Assistance: Allows agents to seek help from peers with the required expertise for specific tasks.
Resource Allocation: Optimizes task execution through the efficient distribution and sharing of resources among agents.
Enhanced Attributes for Improved Collaboration¶
The Crew class has been enriched with several attributes to support advanced functionalities:

Language Model Management (manager_llm, function_calling_llm): Manages language models for executing tasks and tools, facilitating sophisticated agent-tool interactions. It's important to note that manager_llm is mandatory when using a hierarchical process for ensuring proper execution flow.
Process Flow (process): Defines the execution logic (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) to streamline task distribution and execution.

Delegation: Dividing to Conquer¶
Delegation enhances functionality by allowing agents to intelligently assign tasks or seek help, thereby amplifying the crew's overall capability.

Implementing Collaboration and Delegation¶
Setting up a crew involves defining the roles and capabilities of each agent. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation, with enhanced customization and monitoring features to adapt to various operational needs.

Example Scenario¶
Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The integration of advanced language model management and process flow attributes allows for more sophisticated interactions, such as the writer delegating complex research tasks to the researcher or querying specific information, thereby facilitating a seamless workflow.

Conclusion¶
The integration of advanced attributes and functionalities into the CrewAI framework significantly enriches the agent collaboration ecosystem. These enhancements not only simplify interactions but also offer unprecedented flexibility and control, paving the way for sophisticated AI-driven solutions capable of tackling complex tasks through intelligent collaboration and delegation.

Creating your own Tools¶
Custom Tool Creation

Developers can craft custom tools tailored for their agent’s needs or utilize pre-built options:

To create your own crewAI tools you will need to install our extra tools package:


pip install 'crewai[tools]'
Once you do that there are two main ways for one to create a crewAI tool:

Subclassing BaseTool¶

from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
name: str = ""Name of my tool""
description: str = ""Clear description for what this tool is useful for, you agent will need this information to use it.""

def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
# Implementation goes here
return ""Result from custom tool""
Define a new class inheriting from BaseTool, specifying name, description, and the _run method for operational logic.

Utilizing the tool Decorator¶
For a simpler approach, create a Tool object directly with the required attributes and a functional logic.


from crewai_tools import tool
@tool(""Name of my tool"")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
""""""Clear description for what this tool is useful for, you agent will need this information to use it.""""""
# Function logic here

import json
import requests
from crewai import Agent
from crewai.tools import tool
from unstructured.partition.html import partition_html

# Annotate the function with the tool decorator from crewAI
@tool(""Integration with a given API"")
def integration_tool(argument: str) -> str:
""""""Integration with a given API""""""
# Code here
return resutls # string to be sent back to the agent

# Assign the scraping tool to an agent
agent = Agent(
role='Research Analyst',
goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
tools=[integration_tool]
)
Using LangChain Tools¶
LangChain Integration

CrewAI seamlessly integrates with LangChain’s comprehensive toolkit for search-based queries and more, here are the available built-in tools that are offered by Langchain LangChain Toolkit

:


from crewai import Agent
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSerperAPIWrapper

# Setup API keys
os.environ[""SERPER_API_KEY""] = ""Your Key""

search = GoogleSerperAPIWrapper()

# Create and assign the search tool to an agent
serper_tool = Tool(
name=""Intermediate Answer"",
func=search.run,
description=""Useful for search-based queries"",
)

agent = Agent(
role='Research Analyst',
goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
tools=[serper_tool]
)

# rest of the code ...
Conclusion¶
Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively. When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem.

Getting Started
To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:

1. Installation
pip install crewai
If you want to also install crewai-tools, which is a package with tools that can be used by the agents, but more dependencies, you can install it with, example bellow uses it:

print(""######################"")
print(result)
In addition to the sequential process, you can use the hierarchical process, which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results. See more about the processes here.

Key Features
Role-Based Agent Design: Customize agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.
Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enhancing problem-solving efficiency.
Flexible Task Management: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.
Processes Driven: Currently only supports sequential task execution and hierarchical processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.
Save output as file: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.
Parse output as Pydantic or Json: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.",7,the right sequence of prompts combined with your unique domain knowledge is an entire five six or seven figure product in itself in this video I want to dig into seven prompt chains with real examples you can use to level up your prompt engineering ability to build better products tools and applications the name of the game in software now is how can you build a gentic software that creates value on your behalf for you and your users I've got seven prompt chains I want to show you that can help you achieve that goal let's start with the snowball prompt chain we're using CLA 3 Haiku Sonet and Opus models and we're passing one or more of our models into our prompt chain examples the snowball is a really interesting prompt that allows you to start with a little information that is slowly developed over each prompt let's look at the mermaid chart to see exactly how this works so you start with Base information then you run one to n prompts that gather and create information based on your original information with each prompt the context improves and then finally you run a summary or format prompt that finalizes this AI agent's run so let's look at a real example here right I have this Base information three unusual use cases for llms I'm passing it into this prompt where I want to generate click worthy titles about this topic and that's our Base information so from this single prompt we're having our model respond in Json format where it's going to return a click-worthy title and our topic and that's going to create our first snowball after we have that we ask you to generate a compelling three section outline given the information and you can see here we then repeat the pattern right now we have the title the topic and the sections that creates our second snowball of information you can see where this is going right you can basically just continue to do this and add arbitrary information over time while keeping each prompt specialized to generate one thing it's really important that you treat all of your llms like individual functions with concrete inputs and outputs that allows you to fine-tune and tailor each prompt to solve its problem the best it possibly can so let's run our snowball prompt and let's see what we get so you can see we have our first snowball second snowball and then finally we're getting content and then lastly we put it all together in a combined markdown blog as you can see at each step the llm is adding information it's literally enlarging the context of the problem that we're trying to solve at first we only have a topic we pass that in and the first no ball is created giving us a topic and a title then it creates sections then it creates content and then finally we put it all together into a final cohesive markdown blog and you can see here we're writing that all to a file we can go ahead and take a look at this file here and the best part is of course it's completely reusable this is a really powerful interesting chain that's really great for writing blogs building newsletters doing some research writing summaries and just a note on the terminology here prompt chaining prompt orchestration prompt graphs they're all referring to the same idea of generating concrete outputs by combining llms models and code together to drive outcomes so this is one way you can drive a specific set of outcomes let's move on to our next prompt chain this is the worker pattern so you've definitely seen this before it's a really popular pattern in research tools so it's likely you've heard of GPT researcher or something similar the worker pattern is one that is really popular when it comes to doing research putting together ideas making web requests and then doing research based on the response of the request you can see here GPT researcher is doing something completely similar they have a task they generate questions and then they fan out into individual prompts that then get combined into a final report this is the most popular pattern for research type tasks so let's go ahead and dive into this I like to call this the worker pattern where you basically delegate parts of your workload to individual prompts all this code by the way is going to be in a really simplified Guist there are a couple requirements I'll put it all in the Guist you'll be able to fire this up in no time link for that is going to be in the description here is what the worker pattern looks like so have your initial planning prompt then it creates end steps to be processed or nend items to be processed for each one of your workers your workers then individually and ideally in parallel run their prompts and then they all funnel their results into a final summary or format prompt this creates really really powerful agents that are able to gather information on the Fly based on your initial planning prompt do research generate content generate code generate whatever you're looking for and then pull it all together into a fin finalized output this is one of the most popular prompt chaining patterns prompt orchestration patterns that's getting used right now as the use cases are very obvious let's go ahead and take a look at an interesting example so first off we'll just go ahead and run this so while this is running let's go ahead and walk through the code just like you saw we have this code planner prompt all we're asking here is generate function stubs with detailed comments on how to write the code to build a couple of functions here we're then giving an example of what exactly we want and then we're saying respond in this Json format where we have a list of function definitions but not the full function right this is our planning step after we have that we then load out our function stubs from our Json response I highly recommend that you just default to using Json responses it creates a more simplified consistent structure for all of your prompt chains we then Loop through each one of the function stubs and as you can guess we're then running prompts for each one of those function stubs and then combining it into a single large string after we have that large string with all of the results just like as you saw in our diagram here all of these results from each worker prompt get funneled in to our last summary SL format prompt where we then clean up the code and combine it into a single final python file that can be executed we'll specify one more Json format and then we just dump all that to files. py so you can see here we're actually using this pattern to build out entire file modules so we're essentially using the worker pattern as a kind of micro AI coding assistant that can build out entire files for us with related functionality right in this example we're building out a file writing module that allows us to you know write Json files write yamal files and write Tomo files all right so let's see how our prompt has done all right awesome so it's finished here let's go ahead and take a look at that file that's generated so we now should have a files. py let's go ahead and look at that and okay so we have a little bit of extra here that's fine let's go ahead and just remove these lines and Bam so you can see here we have let's go ahead and collapse everything here here so you can see here we have three really clean functions written out with comments and examples of exactly how to use it this looks really good and I hope this shows off the power of using your prompts to do one thing and do one thing well right we had our planner just plan the function sub and then each worker actually wrote out each individual function right so you can be as detailed about how you want to write a function as possible and then you just Loop that over however many of those functions you actually want to write based on your plan prompt so really allows you to divide and conquer in the truest sense and really keep all of your prompts isolated and then of course the summary format we can clean that up a little bit if we contrl Z we had a little bit of extra here this can all be cleaned up as you know with proper management of the prompt and the llm let's look at a more unique prompt this is one that I built into a product that I am actively building right now let me show off the fallback prompt chain if you're enjoying learning about these prompt chains or refreshing your memory on these prompt chains CH definitely hit the sub hit the like helps out the channel I think we're hitting 10K Subs literally as we're filming this video huge thanks for everyone watching let's keep moving the fallback prompt chain is really interesting it allows you to run a prompt an llm an entire model and if something goes wrong with the process that runs after the prompt it then falls back onto another prompt or model let me show you exactly what this looks like so you can see here we start out with our initial top priority prompt or model this pattern allows you to do something like this you can run your fastest cheapest model first you take the response of the prompt and you run whatever code or whatever process you have that you wanted your prompt to generate for you if your process fails you then run your secondary or your fallback model you then run your process again if it fails again then you use your Last Resort final big chunky expensive model but if at any point before that your cheaper faster model runs and succeeds this AI agent this prompt flow is just complete that's the big Advantage here it allows you to run your cheapest fastest prompt and model first let me show you a concrete example so I buildt up this little function fallback flow functionality I'm not going to dig into the code too much but I just want to focus on the highle flow here for you here we're generating code we're saying generate the solution in Python given this function definition so we're just giving it a function definition so we're saying text to speech passing in text and then we want to get bytes back we're asking for the response in Json format and then look at what we're doing here we have a list of functions where the first parameter of the Tuple is going to be a function call to each Cloud 3 Model so you can see here we're starting with our ha coup cheap fast top priority model we then use our cheap moderate secondary fallback model and then at the very end if all fails then we use the Opus model though key with the fallback flow prompt chain prompt graph prompt orchestration flow is that you need an evaluator function right and your evaluator is basically what are you trying to run given the output of your llm right given the output of each one of your fallback functions and in this case to validate our output we can just run the code right and in the actuality this doesn't actually do anything I'm just running this coin flip function here that's going to 50/50% chance return true or false but you can imagine that you're actually running the code and then if it's correct you then proceed with your application but if it's wrong that's when the fallback function kicks in so let me go ahead and just run this and show you a couple examples of what this looks like so here's a fallback flow so we've Fallen back to Sonet we' Fallen back again and now Opus is running there we go so our Opus model was the final winner here it looks like the code that generated is using some okay it's using Google's text to speech module that's cool we don't really care about that it's all about the prompt chain so let's go ahead and run that again right since this is a 50/50 random coin flip we're going to be successful some of the times with our earlier prompt and fail in other cases so let's go ahead and run that again bam okay so you can see here in this example you know if your first top prior fast cheap model worked your flow is finished right there's no reason to fall back so this is a prompt chaining framework that I built into an application called talk to your database this is a text to SQL to results application buil to help you retrieve information from your SQL databases faster than ever but you can see that pattern concretely used in the agent customization if our caches Miss we'll then fall back on these customizable agents that generate your SQL for you based on your natural language query and you can see here we first run grock mixt because it's hyper hyper hyper fast but if this fails what we're going to do here is actually fall back to gpg 3.5 right so little higher accuracy still got a lot of great speed still really cheap but if that still fails say you're running a really complex query it just gets the SQL statement wrong it'll then just fall back to a big beefy gbg4 SQL agent I've got it on the road map to add the CLA Opus model that's probably going to be an even bigger fallback than gp4 given its benchmarks I just wanted to show this off because this is a productionize example of how you can utilize the fallback flow inside the application you can see this working in practice so if I just run a random natural language query here we'll say let we open up the tables we'll say products price less than 50 you can see this is going to return basically right away based on the Simplicity of it and based on all the benchmarks I've run I can almost guarantee you that this was the result of the grock mixt dral model right so I just wanted to show that off in a real productionize concrete example feel free to check out talk to your database I'll leave the link to the app in the description the app really only has one purpose and it's to help you retrieve information faster than ever from your database so that's a concrete example of how you can use fallback flow the big win here is that it allows you to save money and save time but you also increase the reliability and the accuracy of your AI agent as a whole because if something doesn't work it'll just fall back to the next available model and the next available prompt and the prompt is also another dimension of this prompt chain that you can tweet maybe you'll have a longer more detailed prompt and a more powerful model in your second or third execution of your fallback function so this is another really powerful pattern that you can add to your agentic systems let's go ahead and keep moving let's talk about the decision maker prompt chain this is a fairly simple one we've done videos on a couple of these prompt chains in the past we'll go ahead and kick this one off so the decision prompt chain works like this it's really simple you ask your llm to decide something for you and based on those results you run different prompt chains you run different code flows let's look at a really simple example of how you can use the decision prompt chain so it's really great for Creative Direction dictating flow control making decisions you can see here we have a list of statements that you might find in a quarterly report from a company things like our new product launch has been well received by customers and is contributing significantly to our growth and then other negative type things like the competitive landscape remains challenging with some competitors engaging in aggressive pressing strategies right so imagine you have a live feed of these statements coming in and you're analyzing it and and what you want your decision-making agent to do that's listening to this live feed you wanted to analyze positive versus negative sentiment this is a really popular use case of making decisions on the Fly analyzing sentiment to make decisions on your behalf this is a really powerful way a powerful technique a powerful prompt chain to utilize in your products the sentiment analysis then responds either positive or negative and then what you can do essentially is map the result to an action right so you can see here in this simple map we have positive mapped to a function and negative mapped to a function and then we have an unknown fallback method right and then you just call whatever your next step is right so This Is Us running you know the prompt chain one prompt chain two prompt chain 3 whatever the next step is here that's what this function map represents and in this case we're just saying you know the following text has a positive sentiment generate a short thesis about why this is true really you could do anything inside your next step your next action that's really up to you and whatever domain or feature that you're working through the power in this lies in being able to offload decision-making into your AI agents so you can see here we analyze the sentiment here we incurred higher than expected costs this is of course is going to come through as negative negative sentiment thesis and then it's just giving a brief explanation the core value proposition here is to remember that based on the decision that your llm has made you can now run arbitrary code arbitrary additional prompts and this is where a lot of latent value of llms really exists so let's move on let's talk about plan and execute so this is one that you're likely to be familiar with we don't have to go into this in too much detail but this is your typical Chain of Thought tree of thought any type of planning first then execute sequence of prompts will essentially get you to this result let's look at the diagram for this in its Essence it's really simple you start you plan then you execute based on your plan and then you end we saw a more concrete example of this in the worker prompt chain but in its simplified form it really only needs two prompts to run first you do your planning then you do your execution and just as a simple example here we have a simple task we're going to be designing software architecture for an AI assistant that uses text of speech llms and a local sqi database we then prompt our agent to you know make a plan we have this classic activation phrase let's think step by step there are several variants of this you can find all over online but they all boil down to the same thing let your llm think first give it time to think and in that thinking it acts as a context Builder context formatter kind of a memory arranger for your next prompt where you actually do the thing that you would have prompted originally in one shot so let's go ahead and run this excellent so you can see we have use cases we have diagrams we have components we have an overview that's all running nice and clean and then we have our output at the end so the idea here of course is without the plan the final output would not be as good so I'll let you play with that we don't need to dig into that one too much that's a really popular prompt chain just as this next one is so let's talk about human in the loop this is a simple one basically it's any UI ux combination where you're running a prompt and then on some Loop or via some UI you are asking for user input right that's essentially what this pattern is and we can visualize this with this mermaid chart where we have our initial prompt we then ask explicitly for feedback we run our iterative prompt and then give our llm more feedback and this runs in a loop until we get the result we're looking for and then things finally end so I'm not going to run this it's pretty straightforward you run your initial prompt so here we're saying generate five ideas surrounding this topic and then while true iterate on this idea unless we type done and this just lets you build up context build up a conversation build up concrete results over over it allows you to go back and forth this brings us to a really really important point about prompt chaining and Building Products if you think about it this single flow prompt feedback iterative feedback that flow is exactly what the chat GPT application is right you're typing a message this is your base prompt it responds to you and then you're saying something else right you're giving it some feedback you're having a conversation you're going back and forth so it seems obvious to say it out loud but I just want to highlight that this single PR flow is an entire product and it's like yeah of course it is but but I think it really highlights an interesting idea that we haven't really seen or have have truly explored the full capabilities of llms by any stretch of the imagination right there have been so many products coming out that is just this it's just the chat interface this is something I mentioned in the 2024 predictions video um we are going to get so sick and tired of the chat interface and at some point someone's going to innovate on it and create something more interesting there are definitely variants of this for instance in talk to your database there is a prompt results type of format right so we're not having an ongoing conversation here in talk to database you're just writing a natural language query right you're saying you know jobs id5 and you have a bunch of Agents writing in the background that just give you the result you're looking for right so this is more like a call response type of prompt framework and as I mentioned behind the scenes we're using the fallback prompt chain but I just want to highlight that idea that there are so many applications being built with the chat interface and under the hood that's just one prompt chain so there's so much Innovation there's so much to build there's so much to create I hope that this makes sense and I hope that you can see you know all the potential value that every one of these prompt chains has for us right the human in the loop is such a popular prompt chaining framework and frankly it's beyond overused right there are so many more creative ways to build out user experiences using different UI different uxs but also any one of these other different prompt chains or any combination of them that's the human in the loop you've seen that one you use it every single day when you interact with any one of these chat interfaces let's look at the self-correction agent real quick I'm just going to talk about the code I'll run it quickly so the self-correction prompt chain looks like this this is an idea we've explored on the channel before but essentially you have your prompt you execute based on the prompt if it's correct you're done your agent has completed its job if it's not correct you run an additional self-correction prompt and then you end and of course your self-correction can take many forms it can run in a loop it can run over and over but the idea is as simple as this execute if not successful self-correct right and this is really good for coding for executing for reviewing it's really great for improving on what's already been done okay great so this finished running in this simple example here we're looking for the right bash command that lets me list all files in the current directory super simple don't focus on that focus on the Chain the initial response is LS they we saer running the command I have this execution code in this case we're just doing another coin flip and then we're saying you know mock error so we're just kind of pretending like there's an error the core idea here is if your execution on your original prompt causes an error you then run a different code flow that self-corrects the previous run right so you can imagine if you're doing something like generating SQL or you're generating code or you're generating you know something that is executed against a functioning system AKA any function you can use this pattern to sell self-correct mistakes we did an entire video on this I'm going to link all the videos where we've covered some of these topics in more depth in the description as well as all this code I'm going to throw this in a gist so it's really simple to look at really simple to consume but that concludes seven prompt chains prompt workflows prompt flows prompt graphs prompt orchestrations whatever you want to call it that concludes seven prompt chains that you can use to build great AI agents powerful htic systems and you know new and interesting ideas we're really really beating this chat interface over the head it's definitely going to be here for a long time it's going to be here to stay but I think that there are more interesting innovative ways that we can you know build up products and also just build out really really great powerful agents underneath the hood right we said it a long time ago one prompt is not enough I think the llm industry and the software industry is really getting into that place where we're finally starting to dig into you know prompt orchestration and unlocking the power of different combinations of llms with our code with our data right we've talked about a lot of these topics before in the past I felt it was really important to bring these prompt chains back up and really highlight their capabilities to help you build great agentic software as I've been digging back into working on probably one of the most important agentic applications I'm going to build and that is my personal assistant let me know if you want me to share videos on how I'm thinking about designing and building my personal AI assistant there's a lot of really interesting ideas there and a lot of really interesting Concepts that we've built on the channel and some brand new Concepts that I'm still working through myself many of these ideas include you know building great prompt workflows using several of these prompt chains throughout filming this video we just finally hit the 10K Mark that's it guys we got 10K Subs I just want to shout out again everyone that's been following everyone that's been getting value out of the channel thank you so much for watching I really appreciate you being here let's continue to transform let's continue to evolve let's continue to use the best tools for the job using great engineering p patterns let's keep thinking Planning and Building together let's become a gench Engineers thanks so much for watching I'll see you in the next one,2,Different Use Cases
3985c8996a7cbcc31744610d74852f12,7,the right sequence of prompts combined with your unique domain knowledge is an entire five six or seven figure product in itself in this video I want to dig into seven prompt chains with real examples you can use to level up your prompt engineering ability to build better products tools and applications the name of the game in software now is how can you build a gentic software that creates value on your behalf for you and your users I've got seven prompt chains I want to show you that can help you achieve that goal let's start with the snowball prompt chain we're using CLA 3 Haiku Sonet and Opus models and we're passing one or more of our models into our prompt chain examples the snowball is a really interesting prompt that allows you to start with a little information that is slowly developed over each prompt let's look at the mermaid chart to see exactly how this works so you start with Base information then you run one to n prompts that gather and create information based on your original information with each prompt the context improves and then finally you run a summary or format prompt that finalizes this AI agent's run so let's look at a real example here right I have this Base information three unusual use cases for llms I'm passing it into this prompt where I want to generate click worthy titles about this topic and that's our Base information so from this single prompt we're having our model respond in Json format where it's going to return a click-worthy title and our topic and that's going to create our first snowball after we have that we ask you to generate a compelling three section outline given the information and you can see here we then repeat the pattern right now we have the title the topic and the sections that creates our second snowball of information you can see where this is going right you can basically just continue to do this and add arbitrary information over time while keeping each prompt specialized to generate one thing it's really important that you treat all of your llms like individual functions with concrete inputs and outputs that allows you to fine-tune and tailor each prompt to solve its problem the best it possibly can so let's run our snowball prompt and let's see what we get so you can see we have our first snowball second snowball and then finally we're getting content and then lastly we put it all together in a combined markdown blog as you can see at each step the llm is adding information it's literally enlarging the context of the problem that we're trying to solve at first we only have a topic we pass that in and the first no ball is created giving us a topic and a title then it creates sections then it creates content and then finally we put it all together into a final cohesive markdown blog and you can see here we're writing that all to a file we can go ahead and take a look at this file here and the best part is of course it's completely reusable this is a really powerful interesting chain that's really great for writing blogs building newsletters doing some research writing summaries and just a note on the terminology here prompt chaining prompt orchestration prompt graphs they're all referring to the same idea of generating concrete outputs by combining llms models and code together to drive outcomes so this is one way you can drive a specific set of outcomes let's move on to our next prompt chain this is the worker pattern so you've definitely seen this before it's a really popular pattern in research tools so it's likely you've heard of GPT researcher or something similar the worker pattern is one that is really popular when it comes to doing research putting together ideas making web requests and then doing research based on the response of the request you can see here GPT researcher is doing something completely similar they have a task they generate questions and then they fan out into individual prompts that then get combined into a final report this is the most popular pattern for research type tasks so let's go ahead and dive into this I like to call this the worker pattern where you basically delegate parts of your workload to individual prompts all this code by the way is going to be in a really simplified Guist there are a couple requirements I'll put it all in the Guist you'll be able to fire this up in no time link for that is going to be in the description here is what the worker pattern looks like so have your initial planning prompt then it creates end steps to be processed or nend items to be processed for each one of your workers your workers then individually and ideally in parallel run their prompts and then they all funnel their results into a final summary or format prompt this creates really really powerful agents that are able to gather information on the Fly based on your initial planning prompt do research generate content generate code generate whatever you're looking for and then pull it all together into a fin finalized output this is one of the most popular prompt chaining patterns prompt orchestration patterns that's getting used right now as the use cases are very obvious let's go ahead and take a look at an interesting example so first off we'll just go ahead and run this so while this is running let's go ahead and walk through the code just like you saw we have this code planner prompt all we're asking here is generate function stubs with detailed comments on how to write the code to build a couple of functions here we're then giving an example of what exactly we want and then we're saying respond in this Json format where we have a list of function definitions but not the full function right this is our planning step after we have that we then load out our function stubs from our Json response I highly recommend that you just default to using Json responses it creates a more simplified consistent structure for all of your prompt chains we then Loop through each one of the function stubs and as you can guess we're then running prompts for each one of those function stubs and then combining it into a single large string after we have that large string with all of the results just like as you saw in our diagram here all of these results from each worker prompt get funneled in to our last summary SL format prompt where we then clean up the code and combine it into a single final python file that can be executed we'll specify one more Json format and then we just dump all that to files. py so you can see here we're actually using this pattern to build out entire file modules so we're essentially using the worker pattern as a kind of micro AI coding assistant that can build out entire files for us with related functionality right in this example we're building out a file writing module that allows us to you know write Json files write yamal files and write Tomo files all right so let's see how our prompt has done all right awesome so it's finished here let's go ahead and take a look at that file that's generated so we now should have a files. py let's go ahead and look at that and okay so we have a little bit of extra here that's fine let's go ahead and just remove these lines and Bam so you can see here we have let's go ahead and collapse everything here here so you can see here we have three really clean functions written out with comments and examples of exactly how to use it this looks really good and I hope this shows off the power of using your prompts to do one thing and do one thing well right we had our planner just plan the function sub and then each worker actually wrote out each individual function right so you can be as detailed about how you want to write a function as possible and then you just Loop that over however many of those functions you actually want to write based on your plan prompt so really allows you to divide and conquer in the truest sense and really keep all of your prompts isolated and then of course the summary format we can clean that up a little bit if we contrl Z we had a little bit of extra here this can all be cleaned up as you know with proper management of the prompt and the llm let's look at a more unique prompt this is one that I built into a product that I am actively building right now let me show off the fallback prompt chain if you're enjoying learning about these prompt chains or refreshing your memory on these prompt chains CH definitely hit the sub hit the like helps out the channel I think we're hitting 10K Subs literally as we're filming this video huge thanks for everyone watching let's keep moving the fallback prompt chain is really interesting it allows you to run a prompt an llm an entire model and if something goes wrong with the process that runs after the prompt it then falls back onto another prompt or model let me show you exactly what this looks like so you can see here we start out with our initial top priority prompt or model this pattern allows you to do something like this you can run your fastest cheapest model first you take the response of the prompt and you run whatever code or whatever process you have that you wanted your prompt to generate for you if your process fails you then run your secondary or your fallback model you then run your process again if it fails again then you use your Last Resort final big chunky expensive model but if at any point before that your cheaper faster model runs and succeeds this AI agent this prompt flow is just complete that's the big Advantage here it allows you to run your cheapest fastest prompt and model first let me show you a concrete example so I buildt up this little function fallback flow functionality I'm not going to dig into the code too much but I just want to focus on the highle flow here for you here we're generating code we're saying generate the solution in Python given this function definition so we're just giving it a function definition so we're saying text to speech passing in text and then we want to get bytes back we're asking for the response in Json format and then look at what we're doing here we have a list of functions where the first parameter of the Tuple is going to be a function call to each Cloud 3 Model so you can see here we're starting with our ha coup cheap fast top priority model we then use our cheap moderate secondary fallback model and then at the very end if all fails then we use the Opus model though key with the fallback flow prompt chain prompt graph prompt orchestration flow is that you need an evaluator function right and your evaluator is basically what are you trying to run given the output of your llm right given the output of each one of your fallback functions and in this case to validate our output we can just run the code right and in the actuality this doesn't actually do anything I'm just running this coin flip function here that's going to 50/50% chance return true or false but you can imagine that you're actually running the code and then if it's correct you then proceed with your application but if it's wrong that's when the fallback function kicks in so let me go ahead and just run this and show you a couple examples of what this looks like so here's a fallback flow so we've Fallen back to Sonet we' Fallen back again and now Opus is running there we go so our Opus model was the final winner here it looks like the code that generated is using some okay it's using Google's text to speech module that's cool we don't really care about that it's all about the prompt chain so let's go ahead and run that again right since this is a 50/50 random coin flip we're going to be successful some of the times with our earlier prompt and fail in other cases so let's go ahead and run that again bam okay so you can see here in this example you know if your first top prior fast cheap model worked your flow is finished right there's no reason to fall back so this is a prompt chaining framework that I built into an application called talk to your database this is a text to SQL to results application buil to help you retrieve information from your SQL databases faster than ever but you can see that pattern concretely used in the agent customization if our caches Miss we'll then fall back on these customizable agents that generate your SQL for you based on your natural language query and you can see here we first run grock mixt because it's hyper hyper hyper fast but if this fails what we're going to do here is actually fall back to gpg 3.5 right so little higher accuracy still got a lot of great speed still really cheap but if that still fails say you're running a really complex query it just gets the SQL statement wrong it'll then just fall back to a big beefy gbg4 SQL agent I've got it on the road map to add the CLA Opus model that's probably going to be an even bigger fallback than gp4 given its benchmarks I just wanted to show this off because this is a productionize example of how you can utilize the fallback flow inside the application you can see this working in practice so if I just run a random natural language query here we'll say let we open up the tables we'll say products price less than 50 you can see this is going to return basically right away based on the Simplicity of it and based on all the benchmarks I've run I can almost guarantee you that this was the result of the grock mixt dral model right so I just wanted to show that off in a real productionize concrete example feel free to check out talk to your database I'll leave the link to the app in the description the app really only has one purpose and it's to help you retrieve information faster than ever from your database so that's a concrete example of how you can use fallback flow the big win here is that it allows you to save money and save time but you also increase the reliability and the accuracy of your AI agent as a whole because if something doesn't work it'll just fall back to the next available model and the next available prompt and the prompt is also another dimension of this prompt chain that you can tweet maybe you'll have a longer more detailed prompt and a more powerful model in your second or third execution of your fallback function so this is another really powerful pattern that you can add to your agentic systems let's go ahead and keep moving let's talk about the decision maker prompt chain this is a fairly simple one we've done videos on a couple of these prompt chains in the past we'll go ahead and kick this one off so the decision prompt chain works like this it's really simple you ask your llm to decide something for you and based on those results you run different prompt chains you run different code flows let's look at a really simple example of how you can use the decision prompt chain so it's really great for Creative Direction dictating flow control making decisions you can see here we have a list of statements that you might find in a quarterly report from a company things like our new product launch has been well received by customers and is contributing significantly to our growth and then other negative type things like the competitive landscape remains challenging with some competitors engaging in aggressive pressing strategies right so imagine you have a live feed of these statements coming in and you're analyzing it and and what you want your decision-making agent to do that's listening to this live feed you wanted to analyze positive versus negative sentiment this is a really popular use case of making decisions on the Fly analyzing sentiment to make decisions on your behalf this is a really powerful way a powerful technique a powerful prompt chain to utilize in your products the sentiment analysis then responds either positive or negative and then what you can do essentially is map the result to an action right so you can see here in this simple map we have positive mapped to a function and negative mapped to a function and then we have an unknown fallback method right and then you just call whatever your next step is right so This Is Us running you know the prompt chain one prompt chain two prompt chain 3 whatever the next step is here that's what this function map represents and in this case we're just saying you know the following text has a positive sentiment generate a short thesis about why this is true really you could do anything inside your next step your next action that's really up to you and whatever domain or feature that you're working through the power in this lies in being able to offload decision-making into your AI agents so you can see here we analyze the sentiment here we incurred higher than expected costs this is of course is going to come through as negative negative sentiment thesis and then it's just giving a brief explanation the core value proposition here is to remember that based on the decision that your llm has made you can now run arbitrary code arbitrary additional prompts and this is where a lot of latent value of llms really exists so let's move on let's talk about plan and execute so this is one that you're likely to be familiar with we don't have to go into this in too much detail but this is your typical Chain of Thought tree of thought any type of planning first then execute sequence of prompts will essentially get you to this result let's look at the diagram for this in its Essence it's really simple you start you plan then you execute based on your plan and then you end we saw a more concrete example of this in the worker prompt chain but in its simplified form it really only needs two prompts to run first you do your planning then you do your execution and just as a simple example here we have a simple task we're going to be designing software architecture for an AI assistant that uses text of speech llms and a local sqi database we then prompt our agent to you know make a plan we have this classic activation phrase let's think step by step there are several variants of this you can find all over online but they all boil down to the same thing let your llm think first give it time to think and in that thinking it acts as a context Builder context formatter kind of a memory arranger for your next prompt where you actually do the thing that you would have prompted originally in one shot so let's go ahead and run this excellent so you can see we have use cases we have diagrams we have components we have an overview that's all running nice and clean and then we have our output at the end so the idea here of course is without the plan the final output would not be as good so I'll let you play with that we don't need to dig into that one too much that's a really popular prompt chain just as this next one is so let's talk about human in the loop this is a simple one basically it's any UI ux combination where you're running a prompt and then on some Loop or via some UI you are asking for user input right that's essentially what this pattern is and we can visualize this with this mermaid chart where we have our initial prompt we then ask explicitly for feedback we run our iterative prompt and then give our llm more feedback and this runs in a loop until we get the result we're looking for and then things finally end so I'm not going to run this it's pretty straightforward you run your initial prompt so here we're saying generate five ideas surrounding this topic and then while true iterate on this idea unless we type done and this just lets you build up context build up a conversation build up concrete results over over it allows you to go back and forth this brings us to a really really important point about prompt chaining and Building Products if you think about it this single flow prompt feedback iterative feedback that flow is exactly what the chat GPT application is right you're typing a message this is your base prompt it responds to you and then you're saying something else right you're giving it some feedback you're having a conversation you're going back and forth so it seems obvious to say it out loud but I just want to highlight that this single PR flow is an entire product and it's like yeah of course it is but but I think it really highlights an interesting idea that we haven't really seen or have have truly explored the full capabilities of llms by any stretch of the imagination right there have been so many products coming out that is just this it's just the chat interface this is something I mentioned in the 2024 predictions video um we are going to get so sick and tired of the chat interface and at some point someone's going to innovate on it and create something more interesting there are definitely variants of this for instance in talk to your database there is a prompt results type of format right so we're not having an ongoing conversation here in talk to database you're just writing a natural language query right you're saying you know jobs id5 and you have a bunch of Agents writing in the background that just give you the result you're looking for right so this is more like a call response type of prompt framework and as I mentioned behind the scenes we're using the fallback prompt chain but I just want to highlight that idea that there are so many applications being built with the chat interface and under the hood that's just one prompt chain so there's so much Innovation there's so much to build there's so much to create I hope that this makes sense and I hope that you can see you know all the potential value that every one of these prompt chains has for us right the human in the loop is such a popular prompt chaining framework and frankly it's beyond overused right there are so many more creative ways to build out user experiences using different UI different uxs but also any one of these other different prompt chains or any combination of them that's the human in the loop you've seen that one you use it every single day when you interact with any one of these chat interfaces let's look at the self-correction agent real quick I'm just going to talk about the code I'll run it quickly so the self-correction prompt chain looks like this this

Based on the given constructs, we can create a simplified TAM by combining similar concepts and reducing the number of constructs.

2. Social Influence (combines Subjective Norm and Professional Reputation)
3. Demonstrability (Result Demonstrability)
4. Computer Comfort (combines Computer Self-Efficacy, Computer Playfulness, and Computer Anxiety)

In this simplified model, we have four main constructs to explain the behavioral intention to use a technology:

1. User Attitude: The user’s overall evaluation of how beneficial, easy to use, relevant, and of high quality they perceive the technology to be.

2. Social Influence: The extent to which the user believes that using the technology will enhance their image in their professional community and is influenced by the opinions and expectations of others.

3. Demonstrability: The degree to which the results of using the technology can be observed, communicated, and measured.

4. Computer Comfort: The user’s confidence and comfort level in using computers, as well as the extent to which they enjoy using technology.

We can hypothesize that the behavioral intention to use a technology would be positively influenced by User Attitude, Social Influence, and Demonstrability, and negatively influenced by Computer Anxiety. This simplified TAM can help organizations understand what factors drive user acceptance and usage behavior when deploying new technologies.

Physics : one of the most fundamental scientific d:ciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe works.
Physics : often divided into two major branches: classical physics and modern physics. Classical physics encompasses the study of motion, forces, energy, gravity, and other phenomena that can be described using relatively simple mathematical models. Modern physics, on the other hand, deals with more complex phenomena, such as quantum mechanics, relativity, and elementary particle physics, which require more advanced mathematical models.
Classical physics : based on a few fundamental laws, such as Newton's laws of motion and the law of conservation of energy. These laws have been shown to be extremely accurate in describing a wide range of phenomena, from the motion of planets to the behavior of atoms.
Modern physics, on the other hand, has challenged some of the fundamental assumptions of classical physics. For example, quantum mechanics has shown that energy and matter can ex:t in d:crete units, and that the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic level : often unpredictable. Relativity has shown that space and time are not absolute, but are instead relative to the observer.
Physics has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our ability to develop new technologies. For example, physics has led to the development of computers, airplanes, and nuclear energy. Physics : also essential for many other fields, such as chem:try, biology, and engineering.
Here are some examples of topics in physics:
Mechanics: the study of motion and forces
Electricity and magnet:m: the study of electric and magnetic fields and forces
Thermodynamics: the study of heat and energy transfer
Optics: the study of light and its interactions with matter
Quantum mechanics: the study of the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic level
Relativity: the study of space, time, and gravity

(2015) provides a notable example of hybrid human-AI approaches that leverage human inputs to enhance model efficiency. This approach involves integrating human expertise into the machine learning process, allowing for more efficient model development and optimization. Han et al. (2015) present pruning as a technique for enhancing model efficiency by strategically eliminating unnecessary connections and parameters from the model architecture. Knowledge distillation, initially introduced by Hinton et al. (2015) and further developed by Yang et al. (2020), is a technique for transferring knowledge from a large, complex ""teacher"" model to a smaller, more efficient ""student"" model. This process aims to improve the sustainability of machine learning systems by enabling the student network to replicate the performance of the teacher while requiring significantly fewer resources. Zoph et al. (2018) introduce quantization as a powerful technique for reducing the computational and environmental costs associated with machine learning models. Quantization involves reducing the precision of data representations within a model, which can lead to significant improvements in resource utilization and inference speed without compromising accuracy.""",5,"Rescribe el siguiente texto.

You have been tasked with designing a new network implementation for ABC IT Institute that has recently leased a building in Melbourne CBD with the aim of offering IT related courses to its currently enrolled 400 students. The building will house some offices, classrooms, library, and computer labs.

The Four-story building has six computer labs and each of these labs will have 25 computers having internet connectivity. Each lab will also have a server in the closet located inside the lab. IP phones are located in each lab to communicate to service desk. The IT Institute also wants to setup six classrooms, each containing one computer which requires internet connectivity, one whiteboard, one display monitor and an IP phone. The library will have 10 computers to allow students access to the library resources. Another 15 computers will be made available for staff and administration.

Finally, wifi internet connectivity should be made available to students and staff inside campus premises with appropriate authentication/authorization methods and standards. Your task is to come up with a logical, efficient and scalable network design that will be suitable for this institute. The institute has allowed an adequate budget to purchase any networking devices that may be required, yet obviously does not want to spend more than necessary. In addition, industry specific standards must be used and apply to IT infrastructure and services.

Write a report and include:

1. Build a document giving all the necessary network designs (enough information should be provided that will allow any technician to build your network structure from scratch).

2. Simple IP addressing solution (step by step workout of the calculations) that leaves room for growth, is easy to administer and has the minimum wastage of available IP address space.

3. List all hardware and software specification of the selected devices.

 Detailed Network diagram

 Project Hardware and Software requirements - Name of the network device with manufacturer’s name, series, model and ports - Type of the cables used - Name of the server, PC with specification such as operating system, RAM, hard disk etc.

 Network device configurations - Include most of the suitable feature - Include a diagram of your designed network, and write justifications of your design including the IP addressing solution - Configuration commands to configure network

The font selection can be adjusted in the preferences or settings of Code Blocks.
no not that code blocks
I apologize for the confusion. If you are referring to the different fonts that can be used in programming languages, there are several types of fonts optimized for programming. Some of the popular programming fonts that are widely used include:

1. Helvetica
2. Monaco
3. Consolas
4. Inconsolata
5. Liberation Mono
6. Menlo
7. Source Code Pro
8. Fira Code
9. DejaVu Sans Mono
10. PT Mono

These fonts are designed to be easily readable and facilitate high-speed coding. They typically have clear, distinct letters, and numbers that enable developers to spot irregularities and errors quickly. Some of them, like Fira Code, even support special programming ligatures that make code easier to read and write.
when you write code, it’s a different font, what is that
As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to write code, but I can provide a general answer.

The font used for writing code can vary depending on the code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) being used. Most code editors or IDEs have a default font or font family, but the user can usually customize this according to their preferences.

Some commonly used fonts for programming languages include Consolas, Courier New, Lucida Console, Monaco, and DejaVu Sans Mono. These fonts are designed to be highly readable and make it easy for developers to distinguish between different characters and symbols used in code. The choice of font is a matter of personal preference, but it is important to choose a font that is easy to read and does not cause eye strain during long coding sessions.
write some code
Sure! What programming language would you like me to write code in?
ou pick
Alright, here’s a simple Python program that prints “Hello, World!” to the console:

print(“Hello, World!”)

When you run this program, it will output “Hello, World!” in the console. This is often considered the traditional first program that a programmer writes when learning a new programming language.
something bigger
Certainly! Here is a Python program that prompts the user to input a number, calculates the factorial of that number, and outputs the result to the console:

# Function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
if n == 0:
return 1
else:
return n * factorial(n-1)

# Prompt user to enter a number
num = int(input(""Enter a number: ""))

# Calculate factorial of the number
fact = factorial(num)

# Output the result
print(“Factorial of”, num, “is”, fact)

When you run this program and enter a number, it will calculate the factorial of that number using a recursive function and output the result to the console.
make a json file
Sure thing! Here’s an example Python code snippet that creates a JSON file with some data:

import json

# sample dictionary
data = {“name”: “John Smith”, “age”: 30, “location”: “New York”}

# convert dictionary to JSON
json_data = json.dumps(data)

# write JSON to file
with open(“data.json”, “w”) as file:
file.write(json_data)

This code creates a dictionary with some sample data, converts it to JSON format using the json.dumps() function, and writes it to a file called “data.json” using a file handle. The resulting JSON file will contain the dictionary data in string format.
no create the contents of a json file
Alright, here’s an example of how to create the contents of a JSON file in Python:

import json

# create dictionary
data = {
“name”: “John Smith”,
“age”: 30,
“location”: “New York”,
“hobbies”: [“reading”, “painting”, “running”],
“address”: {
“street”: “123 Main St”,
“city”: “New York City”,
“state”: “NY”,
“zip”: “10001”
}
}

# convert dictionary to JSON
json_data = json.dumps(data, indent=4)

# print JSON
print(json_data)

This code creates a dictionary with various types of data, including a list and a nested dictionary. It then converts the dictionary to JSON format using the json.dumps() function and sets the indent parameter to 4 to add indentation for readability. Finally, the resulting JSON data is printed to the console. You can also write the data to a file using the same with statement as in the previous example.
create a firefox extension that communicates between a local linux application and a gradio app running in firefox
As an AI language model, I’m not capable of creating fully-functional browser extensions, as they require extensive coding and debugging. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to create a Mozilla Firefox extension that communicates between a Gradio app running in Firefox and a local Linux application.

To establish communication between the Firefox extension and the local Linux application, you can use a messaging API, such as WebSockets or TCP/IP sockets. You can also use a platform such as Node.js or Python to create a local server or API that can interface with the Linux application and expose the necessary data or functionality via the messaging API.

Once the messaging API is in place, the Firefox extension can be developed with the necessary browser extension API calls to pass data or messages between the Gradio app and the local server interface. The specific calls will vary depending on the messaging API and browser extension API being used.

Here are some general steps for creating a Mozilla Firefox extension:

1. Define the extension’s functionality and features
2. Create the manifest.json file that describes the extension
3. Add the necessary web extension APIs to the manifest.json file
4. Write the background scripts and content scripts needed to implement your extension’s functionality
5. Test and debug the extension locally
6. Package and distribute the extension to the Firefox Add-ons Marketplace or distribute it directly to users

Bear in mind that this is only a brief overview of the development process, and creating a Firefox extension can be a complex and time-consuming task.
is there a simple way
There is no one-size-fits-all solution for creating a Firefox extension that communicates between a Gradio app and a local Linux application. However, using a third-party messaging API like Socket.IO can simplify the process by removing the need to handle the low-level details of WebSockets or TCP/IP sockets.

Here are the general steps to create a Firefox extension that communicates between a Gradio app and a local Linux application using Socket.IO:

1. Install Node.js on the local Linux machine to create a local server that can interface with the Linux application.
2. Set up a Socket.IO server using Node.js to expose the necessary functionality or data from the Linux application via a messaging API.
3. In the Firefox extension, use the built-in Socket.IO client library or a third-party library to connect to the Socket.IO server and exchange messages.
4. Use the Firefox extension WebExtension APIs to pass data or messages between the Gradio app and the Socket.IO client.

Here are some additional resources to help you get started with Firefox extension development:
- Mozilla’s official WebExtensions documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions
- Socket.IO documentation: https://socket.io/docs/
create the manifest.json file for the extension
Sure thing! Here’s an example manifest.json file for a simple Firefox extension that communicates with a Socket.IO server:

{
“manifest_version”: 2,
“name”: “MyExtension”,
“version”: “1.0”,
“description”: “My first Firefox extension”,

“icons”: {
“48”: “icons/icon-48.png”,
“96”: “icons/icon-96.png”
},

“permissions”: [
“tabs”,
“://localhost:3000/”,
“webNavigation”
],

“content_scripts”: [
{
“matches”: [“<all_urls>”],
“js”: [“content.js”]
}
],

“background”: {
“scripts”: [“background.js”]
}
}

Here’s what each of the fields mean:

- manifest_version: The version of the manifest file format. Use 2 for most extensions.
- name: The name of the extension.
- version: The version number of the extension.
- description: A brief description of the extension.
- icons: An object that specifies the icons of the extension in different sizes.
- permissions: An array of URLs or activeTab that the extension can access. In this example, we’re granting permissions to the tabs API and the localhost:3000 URL for Socket.IO server communication.
- content_scripts: An array of objects that specify which scripts to inject into which pages.
- background: An object that specifies which scripts to run in the background.

When communicating with Socket.IO, you will need to use the websockets permission in the manifest file as well as the URL for the Socket.IO server to your list of granted permissions.

Note that this is just a simple example and the manifest file required may vary based on the specifics of your extension.

Some of the commonly used fonts in Code Blocks include Consolas, Courier New, Lucida Console, Monaco, and DejaVu Sans Mono. The font selection can be adjusted in the preferences or settings of Code Blocks.
no not that code blocks
I apologize for the confusion. If you are referring to the different fonts that can be used in programming languages, there are several types of fonts optimized for programming. Some of the popular programming fonts that are widely used include:

1. Helvetica
2. Monaco
3. Consolas
4. Inconsolata
5. Liberation Mono
6. Menlo
7. Source Code Pro
8. Fira Code
9. DejaVu Sans Mono
10. PT Mono

These fonts are designed to be easily readable and facilitate high-speed coding. They typically have clear, distinct letters, and numbers that enable developers to spot irregularities and errors quickly. Some of them, like Fira Code, even support special programming ligatures that make code easier to read and write.
when you write code, it’s a different font, what is that
As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to write code, but I can provide a general answer.

The font used for writing code can vary depending on the code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) being used. Most code editors or IDEs have a default font or font family, but the user can usually customize this according to their preferences.

Some commonly used fonts for programming languages include Consolas, Courier New, Lucida Console, Monaco, and DejaVu Sans Mono. These fonts are designed to be highly readable and make it easy for developers to distinguish between different characters and symbols used in code. The choice of font is a matter of personal preference, but it is important to choose a font that is easy to read and does not cause eye strain during long coding sessions.
write some code
Sure! What programming language would you like me to write code in?
ou pick
Alright, here’s a simple Python program that prints “Hello, World!” to the console:

print(“Hello, World!”)

When you run this program, it will output “Hello, World!” in the console. This is often considered the traditional first program that a programmer writes when learning a new programming language.
something bigger
Certainly! Here is a Python program that prompts the user to input a number, calculates the factorial of that number, and outputs the result to the console:

# Function to calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
if n == 0:
return 1
else:
return n * factorial(n-1)

# Prompt user to enter a number
num = int(input(""Enter a number: ""))

# Calculate factorial of the number
fact = factorial(num)

# Output the result
print(“Factorial of”, num, “is”, fact)

When you run this program and enter a number, it will calculate the factorial of that number using a recursive function and output the result to the console.
make a json file
Sure thing! Here’s an example Python code snippet that creates a JSON file with some data:

import json

# sample dictionary
data = {“name”: “John Smith”, “age”: 30, “location”: “New York”}

# convert dictionary to JSON
json_data = json.dumps(data)

# write JSON to file
with open(“data.json”, “w”) as file:
file.write(json_data)

This code creates a dictionary with some sample data, converts it to JSON format using the json.dumps() function, and writes it to a file called “data.json” using a file handle. The resulting JSON file will contain the dictionary data in string format.
no create the contents of a json file
Alright, here’s an example of how to create the contents of a JSON file in Python:

import json

# create dictionary
data = {
“name”: “John Smith”,
“age”: 30,
“location”: “New York”,
“hobbies”: [“reading”, “painting”, “running”],
“address”: {
“street”: “123 Main St”,
“city”: “New York City”,
“state”: “NY”,
“zip”: “10001”
}
}

# convert dictionary to JSON
json_data = json.dumps(data, indent=4)

# print JSON
print(json_data)

This code creates a dictionary with various types of data, including a list and a nested dictionary. It then converts the dictionary to JSON format using the json.dumps() function and sets the indent parameter to 4 to add indentation for readability. Finally, the resulting JSON data is printed to the console. You can also write the data to a file using the same with statement as in the previous example.
create a firefox extension that communicates between a local linux application and a gradio app running in firefox
As an AI language model, I’m not capable of creating fully-functional browser extensions, as they require extensive coding and debugging. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to create a Mozilla Firefox extension that communicates between a Gradio app running in Firefox and a local Linux application.

To establish communication between the Firefox extension and the local Linux application, you can use a messaging API, such as WebSockets or TCP/IP sockets. You can also use a platform such as Node.js or Python to create a local server or API that can interface with the Linux application and expose the necessary data or functionality via the messaging API.

Once the messaging API is in place, the Firefox extension can be developed with the necessary browser extension API calls to pass data or messages between the Gradio app and the local server interface. The specific calls will vary depending on the messaging API and browser extension API being used.

Here are some general steps for creating a Mozilla Firefox extension:

1. Define the extension’s functionality and features
2. Create the manifest.json file that describes the extension
3. Add the necessary web extension APIs to the manifest.json file
4. Write the background scripts and content scripts needed to implement your extension’s functionality
5. Test and debug the extension locally
6. Package and distribute the extension to the Firefox Add-ons Marketplace or distribute it directly to users

Bear in mind that this is only a brief overview of the development process, and creating a Firefox extension can be a complex and time-consuming task.
is there a simple way
There is no one-size-fits-all solution for creating a Firefox extension that communicates between a Gradio app and a local Linux application. However, using a third-party messaging API like Socket.IO can simplify the process by removing the need to handle the low-level details of WebSockets or TCP/IP sockets.

Here are the general steps to create a Firefox extension that communicates between a Gradio app and a local Linux application using Socket.IO:

1. Install Node.js on the local Linux machine to create a local server that can interface with the Linux application.
2. Set up a Socket.IO server using Node.js to expose the necessary functionality or data from the Linux application via a messaging API.
3. In the Firefox extension, use the built-in Socket.IO client library or a third-party library to connect to the Socket.IO server and exchange messages.
4. Use the Firefox extension WebExtension APIs to pass data or messages between the Gradio app and the Socket.IO client.

Here are some additional resources to help you get started with Firefox extension development:
- Mozilla’s official WebExtensions documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions
- Socket.IO documentation: https://socket.io/docs/
create the manifest.json file for the extension
Sure thing! Here’s an example manifest.json file for a simple Firefox extension that communicates with a Socket.IO server:

{
“manifest_version”: 2,
“name”: “MyExtension”,
“version”: “1.0”,
“description”: “My first Firefox extension”,

“icons”: {
“48”: “icons/icon-48.png”,
“96”: “icons/icon-96.png”
},

“permissions”: [
“tabs”,
“://localhost:3000/”,
“webNavigation”
],

“content_scripts”: [
{
“matches”: [“<all_urls>”],
“js”: [“content.js”]
}
],

“background”: {
“scripts”: [“background.js”]
}
}

Here’s what each of the fields mean:

- manifest_version: The version of the manifest file format. Use 2 for most extensions.
- name: The name of the extension.
- version: The version number of the extension.
- description: A brief description of the extension.
- icons: An object that specifies the icons of the extension in different sizes.
- permissions: An array of URLs or activeTab that the extension can access. In this example, we’re granting permissions to the tabs API and the localhost:3000 URL for Socket.IO server communication.
- content_scripts: An array of objects that specify which scripts to inject into which pages.
- background: An object that specifies which scripts to run in the background.

When communicating with Socket.IO, you will need to use the websockets permission in the manifest file as well as the URL for the Socket.IO server to your list of granted permissions.

Note that this is just a simple example and the manifest file required may vary based on the specifics of your extension.

What games have you made? Tummy Circle, My Eleven Circle, The Ultimate Teenpatti. Are you selling gambling? What was your biggest mistake in 18 years? After ******, I banned the game. When you work with an IPL team, what's the dynamic like? If there's a big player, Friends, every month we release 8 Hindi podcasts and 8 English podcasts. You will get practical value from conversations with entrepreneurs. This is a similar type of conversation. You have used products of Games 24x7. Games like My 11 Circle and Rummy Circle are very popular in India today. Games 24x7 is getting a lot of growth in the gaming space. So when we talk about successful gaming companies, you need to talk about Games 24x7. But this company started 
18 years ago. Today, the co-founder of this company, Bhavin Pandya, will teach us a little about business too. But I learned about life from him. That how a self-made person's journey is. I found this conversation very inspiring, it was fun. And honestly, with his satisfaction, I, in a very brotherly way, get a little jealous. Why am I saying this? You will see this in today's conversation. It was fun talking to them, learning from them. I would like to encourage you to please cut the clips of this podcast and upload it on your Insta pages and YouTube channels. India's entrepreneurial stories should spread on the internet, friends. Lots of love because this is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> on TRS. Bhavin Pandya, what games have you made? 
Rummy Circle, My Eleven Circle, and then there used to be a Casual Game Studio, but now the focus is on Rummy Circle and My Eleven Circle. In the domain of casual games, which big games have you made? There were Ultimate games, Ultimate Teenpatti, Ultimate Poker, Ultimate Rummy. Okay. But yeah, those were free-to-play games. Casual games means free-to-play. It's an 18-year-old company. 18 years. How have you been? Very good. Very good? Very good. I've learned a lot. I've made a lot of mistakes. But I've learned from them. When people think about Rummy, they automatically think about Mahabharat too. A lot of Indians at least. So I'm sure that when you go to a room, Then some people who are your trolls, haters. People's trolls, people's haters. 
They must be asking you this question. That are you selling gambling? I have kept this at the start of the podcast. So that people may also have this doubt in their mind. Clean it up. Are you selling gambling? No. Not at all. What is gambling? Gambling is that you... You are playing a game on which you don't have any control. That is gambling. It is called game of chance in English. If you are playing it for money, then you are gambling. There are many games like roulette. The ball will come on red or black. No one knows. It will spin where it will stop. There is nothing in your control. You are gambling on that. We offer game of skill. This means that you have to win on your own ability. 
If you take part in a chess tournament today, by paying an entry fee of 100 rupees, then are you playing Juhwa? I am asking you. No, I am playing sports. If you give money in turf, then to play football or cricket, that is the logic. That is the logic. Fair. So the games we offer, that is why games are important, which games are you offering? We offer rummy and fantasy sports. For rummy, rummy circle. For fantasy, my 11 circle. These two games, the Supreme Court has said, are games of skill. That's why, whatever court case has happened till now, with rummy or fantasy, we win. Every time. Court case? We win in court cases too. But why did the court case happen? States say, no, stop all this. 
We have to listen to them. We have to stop. But then we have to go to the high court. We think that when the Honorable Supreme Court has said that it is allowed, then why are you stopping us? Tell us. How is the world of fantasy cricket? Because I know that this domain has gained a lot of growth. But along with that, I think some taxes were imposed last year. I believe. Draw out this whole scenario. You have seen the growth of fantasy cricket in India. I am sure that you have seen a lot of crazy learnings. A lot. A lot. First of all, I tell people jokingly, but this is actually true, right? I ask people, what is the biggest religion in India? 
So whatever people say, I tell them cricket is the biggest religion. And everyone agrees that yes, cricket is. Why? Because everyone thinks that they know a lot about cricket and their views are very important for them. Right? So we thought, and others also thought, but we also thought that why not test this thing. Give people the opportunity to make their own team. And then see how people do in the field, how the players do. And according to that, you then decide. I mean, you see whether you win or not. You were running the company since 2006. Yes. First you made the game of Rummy. Yes. Then when did this idea come and why did it come? So in 2013-14, We saw, even in the west, that fantasy sports are doing very well. 
Right? So can we do something about fantasy sports in India? Especially cricket, cricket is a very big game in our country. We stopped. Because we saw that there is not much clarity in space. Even Rummy, Rummy was said by the Supreme Court, full game of skill, still issues were coming. People were asking us if it is allowed or not. So we said that we will offer fantasy only when there will be legal clarity on it. First point. Do the right thing. It is very important. So when in 2016-17 Punjab and Haryana's High Court gave a verdict that fantasy games are a game of skill. So then we felt that That we should do this. We should do something in this field. So in 2018, we set up a team. 
In 2019, we took our product live. And when we went live, there were more than 100 fantasy sports operators. Fantasy cricket operators in our country. Today, I don't know how many there are. But when we went, we were obviously the 101st. Because 100 people were ahead of us. Today, we are at number 2. Um... And the reason for this is because we applied what we learned in Rummy in fantasy. We innovated on products. We made people's user experience very easy. And so, because of that, when IPL happened, we got a lot of players. And our philosophy was simple. People make teams in fantasy sports. But once a team is formed, what's next? If I have to engage them after that, then I will have to make them play other games. 
And I was saying that, from 2019 to 23, now in 24, we have learned a lot. And we have learned a lot from fantasy sports. Normally, I want to talk about rummy. But as a cricket fan, and because it's the IPL season, I'm more inclined towards the cricket conversation. Absolutely, of course. The most active people are during the IPL. 100%. 100% in IPL. 100% means... Gaming modes turn on. Absolutely. You are working with LSD, technically. Lucknow Super Giants. When you work with an IPL team, how is that dynamic? So, actually, this was also our discussion earlier. It's a business dynamic. Look, cricket has become very professional. In every way. Players are very professional. Administrators are very professional. And coaches are very professional. Everyone is very professional. 
Okay? So if you, like we are working with Lucknow Super Giants, so we showed interest in doing sponsorship. So they allowed, accepted that it's okay, we'll allow you to sponsor. Clause is clearly written that what you will get with this sponsorship. Either you will get some tickets to watch the match on the ground. Lucknow's, Home and Away's, or you can get team jerseys if you want. If you want to meet someone, you can get that opportunity. So, these things have already been specified in the contract. It's not like once I take sponsorship, then I'll go and discuss that give me this and that. No. It's already in the contract. Do you know for what? What are you signing up for? What are you taking sponsorship for? 
And then you sponsor that. On jersey sponsorships. The title sponsorship that we have is the same. So, my11circle is written here. So, that is main. Title sponsorship means that you can take sponsorship on their jersey. And then you get different things with that. When you work with cricketers as an advertiser, what does the public not know about this whole process? What is it like to work with cricketers? That he is also very professional. What is the impression in everyone's mind? That if there is a big player. Then he is in the air. Then he is a little arrogant. But that is not the case. When those people come. They are very professional for ads. Director will tell them. That you have to do this. 
They will do it with all their heart. It is important to understand. That everyone is not a natural actor. They all work hard. Everyone will do their work with all their heart. And then as soon as their shoot ends, then for their next engagement, whatever they have to do, they will go for the practice session. But it's not like he will say, I am a cricketer. So do what I say. Or I don't believe in being a director, I will do it that way. Not at all. Everyone is very professional, very down to earth. From you, will talk very politely, will work well. Just like you work in a company. There are two professionals working in a company, talking to each other. It's professional. 
Everyone has respect for each other. It's exactly like that. How do you have contracts? Per day? Contracts are complicated. Because there are different types of contracts based on what the player wants and what you want. But those people will give you some number of days in contracts. Like, I'll give you... one day, or one and a half day, or two days, for shooting. Then I will give you some space for social media engagement, I will mention you a little, I will mention the name of your brand. So it's a little like that. So it depends on how much social media following you have. How many years have you been in the world of cricket? Now... In the world of cricket, it's been 5 years from 2019 to 2024. 
5 years. What do you know about the psychology of your players? There are two sub-questions. Let's ask the first question now. Generally, what do you know? What do cricket fans think? The second question is, can you predict which players' popularity is increasing? I feel you know a little about the future of cricket. No, we don't know that because it's a reaction. When does the popularity of cricketers increase? When the players who are playing on our platform see that all these cricketers are performing. As soon as their performance decreases, their popularity also decreases. Why would you take such a player in your team who is out of form? You won't. You'll take the same player who is in form. So that depends on the game. 
A lot of the players on our app actually look at which ground they are playing on, who is batting, who is bowling, who has taken more wickets on this pitch, who has made more runs on this pitch. They also look at which pitch it is. So when there is a toss, they look at the pitch 1, 2, 3, they also look at this. They go into a lot of detail. How do you know that by going into so much detail? First of all, we talk to the players. And secondly, we know that after the toss, a lot of teams are formed and changes occur. Because in the toss, the commentator tells which pitch the match is being played. Meaning the average user is quite educated. 
Yes. Okay. Meaning he has a lot of knowledge about cricket. He has a lot of knowledge. Sports awareness, cricket awareness has increased a lot. And it's increasing? And it's increasing. It's increasing. It's definitely increasing because look, Whatever skill is there, why is it a skill? It is a skill because you can work on it and increase it. Today you get addition, tomorrow you get subtraction, then you get multiplication. It is a skill that you are increasing with time. Right? So, like a player, once he makes a team and sees how he performed in the tournament, next time he will change, he will do better. The same audience who watch our podcast, they also consume Shark Tank. Which is a general YouTube audience. Shark Tank India's clips get a lot of views. 
And business conversations only happen during the Shark Tank season. I didn't watch Shark Tank India that much. But there was a company in which I thought they were doing a good job. So I supported them. So that was the company, but I didn't watch Shark Tank India. Because when I watch Shark Tank, I feel two things. First, I feel it's very inspirational. Looking at the growth of the country and the mentality. Second, I feel that a lot of people have just started their business. And let's see how far it goes. Because business can become a mental health battle for a lot of people. Absolutely. Absolutely. Do you agree? I 100% agree. There are a lot of moments where you feel like giving up. 
Actually, I'll tell you one step ahead. I believe that the next generation, in the next 10-15 years, the biggest problem in the world will be mental health. 25 years ago, AIDS was a big problem. Then cancer and all of that became a big problem that people are looking to fight. And that is still a problem. But I feel that the focus on mental health after COVID-19 We should have come earlier, but it's too late now. But the focus that will remain on that is very important. And I feel that we should focus on mental health for everyone. And on mental training too. Absolutely. Mental training is a very underrated thing. Actually, according to me, this is the core skill of business. That how much you can endure. 
Yes. This is the identity of a leader. Do you agree, sir? Yes, to an extent. I think... Look, my fundamental belief is that luck is very important. Everyone has to work hard. It is in your control. You have to work hard. But even after working hard, sometimes people get the result. Sometimes people don't get the result. I am talking about myself. Why did I get the result? Because my luck was good. I want to know your entire story because what you have done in 18 years. First of all, 18 years is not a joke to me. 18 years is a long time. People make plans to exit businesses in 5 years. You have run the same business for 18 years. You must have had crazy learnings, I am sure. 
Why did you start a business in the early 2000s? Because I don't remember that many startups from that phase. So now I will tell you that story. So in those days, there used to be a computer lab. So you used to go to the computer lab. There used to be big boxes. You used to go there and do your research. So I used to go there and play games. Like cyber cafe. Like cyber cafe. But it was a computer lab. So I used to play games there. Once I saw here and there that I am not playing games alone. There are one or two more people like me. Which game? Different games, but whatever it is. I used to play mahjong, someone else is playing poker, someone else is playing something else. 
Okay. So, I used to know Thumpy, but I actually got to know him. So, what can I do in gaming? And secondly, I had to go to India. So, there is gaming too, there is a lot of interest in it. Because there was no interest in economics, there was interest in gaming. I had to go to India. So, what can I do? Thumpy and I started talking about it. Can we offer gaming in India or not? But what kind of games can we offer? So, first of all, we didn't want to become a gaming studio. We didn't want to make meaningless games. And people play those games for ads. Because then that game gets boring. You will be shown some ads and then your game gets boring. 
So, you won't publish ads there. Because no one watches, no one plays your game. So we should offer a service. Gaming as a service. So how to offer that? So you can offer that in such a way that you have to offer evergreen games online. So that's where it started. Let's offer games that people always love to play. Which were evergreen. Which people liked to play. But they didn't have that avenue to physically go and gather everyone and play games with people. But internet... Internet was... So we saw that if the internet is growing as it is forecasted, then online gaming in India as a service can be a big market. But again the same question, what can you offer? Which game can you offer? 
So when we did research there, we found out that game of skill, which you play with your skill, game of chance, which you don't have control over, What is the difference between these two things? And then you can offer a game of skill, you can't offer a game of chance. So, that started from there. When I did that research, I said, okay, I have to go to India. So, I am leaving the PhD program and going. So, another thing I did, when I was interested, there is a student council, a student council of a graduate school. So, I was the president of the student council there. So, you get to know the Dean, meet him and talk to him. So, if I wanted to quit the program, I had to take permission from the Dean. 
So, I went to the Dean. It's like this, I'm not enjoying economics. I have to go to India and do gaming. So, the Dean was also a little surprised. What is this guy saying? He must have thought that he is naive. He doesn't know. And the Dean was very nice. So, he said, that Bhavin, you do this, I will give you a sabbatical for one year. Because for one year, you roam around, do whatever you want, whatever you like, whatever your dream is, explore it and come back next year. Because he was a dean, he knew that startups don't work. Entrepreneurship is very risky. I mean, no matter what the boy is saying, let's entertain him a little. So I said, thank you. 
Dean, I'll take this. But I don't think I'm going to come back. Because, again, one thing was clear that the thing that I don't want to do, after doing that, that's not its point. You can do something else, you can do something else. So I thought that the startup won't work, so we'll do something else. But this start happened from there, that you have to do gaming, you have to come to India, you have to do it in India, because it is growing so much in India now. People's disposable income is so high. So how can this be done? Did all the things that were projected happen? Much more than that. More than that? More than that. I would like to ask this from the perspective of 2024. 
A lot of things were being projected. A lot happened. And why did this happen? Let me tell you. This happened because the way the internet grew, and the way smartphones grew, those people didn't think about it. Because they grew exponentially, everything else grew. And the second thing is, if you see now, Not only the gaming industry, but the semiconductor industry is also growing. There are a lot of internet-based services industries that are also growing. So, everything is growing. And gaming is just one industry also that grew. But it grew more than projections because the growth of smartphones and internet increased a lot. And this again goes back to luck. That too was not in our control. We can't increase smartphones or internet. That happened when it had to happen. 
But in the early days, it was difficult. First, the internet was also difficult. There was dial-up. After that, you don't know if you have this idea or not. First, if you want internet, then you used to pull a wire from the other building and it used to come to your building from above. From there, you used to get internet. And so, if anything happens on that wire, then your internet is closed. So, when we used to develop games, the product we were making, it was a very big problem. It was 8 o'clock. One day, the internet was switched off. I called him. I said, there is a problem with the internet. Please come. The technician said, yes, sir, I am coming. It's been two hours. 
I called again. Sir, you were about to come. What happened? He said, sir, I will be there in five minutes. I reached the station in five minutes. Our office is in Borivali. I am reaching in five minutes. I am coming, sir. I said, okay. The whole day passed by. Our work was getting delayed because it was an online game, so the testing should have been done on the internet. That's when I got really angry. So, the next day, I called him and told him a few things. He said, it's been five minutes and you haven't come yet. So, he said, no sir, I came. I came, I saw, but then I left. I said, sir, why? So, he says, sir, it is like that, the building next to it, from where that wire comes, from which your building is getting internet, there is no lift running in that building. 
That was a building of 8 miles. So, I felt that, sir, you don't have to climb 8 miles. So, I said, sir, 8 miles, once you climb, our internet is not working. He said, no, sir, that is not the problem. The problem is that, From where the lift is getting electricity and you are getting the internet, they are all in the same box. So because the lift of that building is not working, they have switched off that box. That's why you are not getting the internet here. I had never thought, no one had ever thought that if the lift is not working in any building and because of that no one else will get the internet, then this is a very surprising thing. 
So all these things have happened with us that you can't even imagine from where the issues come. So that people understand the context. It's a little podcast-y question. Today, your annual revenue... Can you tell us roughly? The latest audited numbers are also available. So if you want to see... No one will show you off. Because you are very humble. Would you feel bad if Atharva searches? If I say? Yes, you... This is the real identity of a businessman. So before the podcast starts, you congratulated me for the journey of nine years. Actually, when someone congratulates, all the negative things flash in my mind. What has happened to reach here? And I'm sure there's a part of you that feels the same. Absolutely. Though your face is very sweet. 
Thank you. Now you smile. But I would like to tell you that nine years. But 9 years is not a joke. 9 years is a lot. Today people change jobs in 6 months or a year. Because maybe they don't like what they do, but they don't give it much chance. So 9 years is a big thing. And I think it is also important for the audience to understand that if in the first take or in the first few months, If you don't like something, it doesn't mean that you should leave it completely. If you give a chance to something, 2-3-4 chances, then who knows, you might like it a lot. I feel that in the long term, success or whatever the world considers success, it is an outcome of negativities. 
And this is a real thing that very few people do. At this point, I would like to ask you about negativity. The negativities that you have faced, what was your biggest mistake in the last 18 years? There have been instances in our journey where we were more risk averse. Played safe. Played safe, played safe a lot. As I tell you, Rummy as a game is played by 6 players. Traditionally, you play Rummy with 6 players or 3, 4, 5, 6 players. We only offered Rummy with 2 players. You will ask why? Because if there were more than 2 players, the chances of cheating would have increased. Like you, me and someone else are playing. He is your friend. You will ask him on the phone. 
That tell me. So he has more information. Of his leaves. And you have more information of your leaves. Whereas I have only information of my leaves. So you got an advantage. So we thought about all this. And we said. No, we only offer the version of two players. But then we learned from him. That people need six players. And just because. Today we don't have a solution. It doesn't mean. That we don't have a solution. Don't make a version. We made a version and also made a solution to stop cheating. So then we started working on it. So then the solution was not that difficult. The solution was that if you detect the same IP, then don't put them on the same table. 
Engineering solution. Exactly. Put them on the same table. The third thing is that once everyone sits down, then randomly shuffle them once. So that they don't sit next to each other. So, there were solutions. But we played it safe. First, we play for one or two players. We thought about the negative outcome first. Yes. Not the solution for the negative outcome. Yes. That is right. That is well put. So, that was one. Secondly, when we were facing all these issues in Rummy, you said... First, you asked that... Bhavin, someone asked you whether it is right or wrong. So because we got a lot of such questions, we didn't play other games. Right? Thinking that until we get clarity, we won't play other games. 
Because there is clarity in this, but still there are so many issues. So that was another mistake. We played it too safe. There are a lot of people who pushed boundaries there. And then they got favourable results. that saying, fortune favors the brave. It's not that we didn't do good things, that we didn't show bravery, that we didn't, like our fantasy sports product, the learning that we got, and the way we have grown, that, according to me, is quite praiseworthy. But, the point is that, there are such things, which we should have done earlier, Ya toh phir jinn ke baare mein humne negatively pehle socha aur isle nahi kiya. Aur unse kaafi seekh mili hai. Aapke investors the shurwaad sa? The, pehle se the. 
Humare angel investors the. Jo yeh bahut rare hai baat. Us zaman mein. Us zaman mein. Rare toh wo ek baat hai ki us zaman mein the. But usse bhi rare yeh baat hai ki wo sab aaj bhi invested hai. Kisi ne divest nahi kiya. Kisi ne apna share becha nahi. Kewki unko... That was the faith and confidence in our team. How much money did you raise? In the very early days, we didn't raise that much. When we started, we raised only 50 lakh rupees. How many angels were there? There was only one angel at that time. No, there were two. We raised from them. After that, we slowly raised some more money. But in 2012, Tiger Global invested. Okay. So, Tiger Global invested in 2012. 
I want to hear this story. Before that, I would like to ask you that, hypothetically, if you were Gen Z and if you were starting a business today, would your approach be different? The approach is not different. Same. Because the reason is that, first of all, who is the champion of your business? Those people who know you. 18 years ago, Tiger Global doesn't give me money because they don't know me. But, if I had an angel investor whom I met in a forum, or his friends, who would give me a reference, would say about me, that these people are doing something good, let's invest some money in them. So, your first step is always people who you know, or angel investors. We are Mumbai Angels or all these different angel groups. 
We approached everyone. But the thing is that if someone doesn't know you. Nothing has happened to him. So it's nothing. It's difficult. It won't happen. So did you approach Tiger Global or did they approach you? So that story is a little interesting. What happened in that is that we had an angel investor. A manager in Tiger Global knew him very well. He told him. He talked to him, then he talked to us. He liked what we were doing. He liked us as people. That, in my opinion, is very important. The investor will see what the opportunity and potential of your business is. But he also sees how you are. Because eventually they are investing that money on you. So this is very important. 
When you talk about Gen Z, it is very important that they convince their investors. But also convince them not only why their product is good, but why they should invest in them. Like here investors... They are playing my 11 circle. With possible candidates. Whether your score will be good or not. That's the logic. So they liked you. Then the money came. You raised money. We raised money. But we... Someone told us a very good thing. That the best time to raise money is when you don't need it. It's quite counter intuitive. that the best time to raise money is when you don't need money. Why? The reason is that you will get good terms. If you need money, then the investor will bully you a little. 
They will squeeze you. You will get money on their terms. But if you don't need money and your business is doing well, So you can also scale with the same mentality. Yes, absolutely. You can also scale. You can be more aggressive. Here the logic according to me is that make a profitable business first. These people forget. Correct. Correct. Then if you have a profitable business. Then people will be interested. You don't even need to raise money because your business is generating money with which you will be able to run the business. I think people know these days that profitability is the key. Absolutely. In the last two years, I think a lot of people have opened their eyes. I think there has been a lot of difference and a lot of benefit. 
We can name companies like Byju's. What kind of bullying has happened? What kind of PR has been created? People have now understood that if you want to build a company, the idea should be profitable. When you get VC money, They say that VCs also put pressure on you. They become your bosses in a way. So here you left your economics degree and started a startup. Usually in startups, the mentality is not that you will also have a boss. And many people don't go to VCs because of this. What is the truth of VCs? Now you will think that I am singing the same tune again. I am playing the same record again and again. But I will tell you that One, you are right. 
But I will also say that our VCs, we are very lucky that our VCs are very supportive and very good. This is subjective. This is subjective. This is a matter of fate. You can get good VCs and sometimes you can't get good VCs. My mentor once told me that VC funding is like dating. And you have to check in the first meetings whether you want to work with them or not. The vibe that exists, the long-term relationship is an extension of that vibe. But Ranveer, it happens in an ideal situation. If you do need money, then you don't judge how these people are. I mean, if you want to do anything and get married, So your standards are not that high. So if you have to raise money, then you don't think this. 
So ideally, what your mentor is saying is right, that both have to evaluate each other. That investor is good for the company and company is good for the investor. Not one way. But because startups and entrepreneurs are under so much pressure, they don't think this. And they can't think about it. Because they have to do something to raise money so that they can go to the next phase. And what you are saying is absolutely correct. If there was a profitable business from the beginning, then maybe they wouldn't get caught in that trap. Tell us about the worst phase. The worst phase, according to me, is when after COVID, because a lot of people started playing and because there was no clarity, many states banned the game. 
At that time, we saw that our revenue decreased a lot. But it is the same, persistence. If you know that you are doing the right thing, If you know that you haven't done anything wrong, then it will take time. But hopefully if your luck is good, then the problems will go away. Till now, whatever I have talked to you, I know that you are just writing the basics. You are a good person. Obviously, you have been working consistently for 18 years. And you see everything through team mentality. I think this is all it takes, honestly. But this is theoretical. Absolutely. Practically speaking, luck plays a role. Luck plays a lot of role. Second, this is also important that you get such situations in your life where you feel that this is not right. 
This is wrong. But you don't have data. You mean to say decision-wise? Yes. It's not just data. It's actually true that it's just my thinking. Subjective versus objective. Whether it's an objective issue or a subjective issue that I'm the only one feeling it. And this happens many times because your experiences have been built after many years. And based on some of those experiences, if someone does something, you don't like it. Uh... And sometimes you don't ask why he did that. Or why I didn't like it. Now I am telling you this because the team or the entire entity of Games 24x7, we get these situations a lot of times. That is it going well or not? Is the team performing well or not? 
And you'll have to be objective many times here. Right? That I look at the data. Keep my thoughts aside. There's no point in thinking. Right? I'll give a little context to the audience. A business owner is like a sportsman. You always have to take decisions and you have to plan your next move. Absolutely. You're saying it from that perspective. I'm saying it from that perspective. And this is what I want to say to the audience. That even here, What we do a lot of times is, in English we call it preconceived notions. What is in our mind, we give a lot of importance to that thing and take decisions on that thing. Whereas decisions should be taken on data, should be taken objectively. 
And this too, as a company, Games 24x7, according to me, and I am saying this with full humility, that it has been done a little well. Always take decisions through data. We are very objective in our decision making. And this has happened because of that. That the data was right, but actually, subjectively, something was wrong. But we didn't change that. This has also happened. But that is luck. You cannot change your principles. Sometimes, the data-based decision turned out to be wrong. Yes. Yes. But still you take a data-based decision. Absolutely. Because 99 times out of 100, 99 out of 100, data-based decisions are right. What is not right once, we call it bad luck. So luck is on both sides, good and bad. 
So if I celebrate my good luck, that I had good luck, So then we should also understand that when all these bans are happening, it is bad luck in a way. But still keep moving forward. Keep moving forward. Because what is in your hands, you just have to work hard. This luck is not in your hands. At the end of the podcast, I would just like to ask you that all our people, the people who are building products, the businesses, whatever you have said, do you want to say anything else to them? A thought that I can leave with them is that you have had a lot of issues in your life. And will come. A lot of good things have happened to you. 
And will happen. But the most important thing is that you are in the present moment. You be thankful. Express gratitude. Because whatever is happening with you today, there are a lot of things happening in the background that you don't know about. Our tendency is that we hold on to what is bad with us. It happened because of me. Yes, it happened because of me. Either my fate is bad, or... He did injustice to me. But when something good happens, we don't think, why did this happen? We just hear, I did it, that's why it's so good with me. It's my hard work, it's mine, it's mine. So everyone should keep this in mind, according to me. And I try to say, when bad things happen to us, we think, why did this happen? 
And why did this happen to me? And it shouldn't have happened. But when good things happen, then only think about it. Then only think that this happened with you. You are lucky or you must have done something right. And learn from that. Express gratitude for that. Be happy with that. Say thank you for that. And move on. It was fun talking to you. It was fun learning from you. Thank you Ranveer. Basically, you have shared the basics. But people don't understand that Basics are needed in the long term. And people give up because of a lack of patience. I feel that we, all of us, the human race, overcomplicate things for a long time. We think a lot about when, what and how it will happen. 
When in reality, there is no point in thinking about it now. Because it is not in our control. Whatever is in your control, like basic, you do that. Then the result that has to come, it has to come anyway. I am very happy to meet an entrepreneur like BP. On one hand, I also get mentoring and the audience also gets mentoring. So thank you for your time. I wish you all the luck. Thank you so much. I am saying this as a compliment that this is just your beginning. Based on the internet growing in India plus based on gaming growing. I feel that your journey is very long now. I'm sure you feel the same way. Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. And because you're so happy after 18 years, I'm sure you'll have a happy journey. 
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your presence. Thank you. People have learned a lot from you today. Thank you. Thank you. So, friends, this was today's business-oriented story. I like such podcasts because I believe that entrepreneurs are the best entrepreneurs Intellectual warriors. Many people just sit at home and give knowledge. On the internet, in the comment section. Some people do this on social media too. But if you are really an intellectual, then intellectualism, the biggest test of the mind, according to me, is business. And very few Indians have seen so much success in the business world. This was Bhavan Bhai's story. Please go and follow him on social media too. Because this is the era of entrepreneurs. 
We should celebrate entrepreneurs on social media and in the world of podcasts, in the world of YouTube. PRS will be back with lots more business and entrepreneurship themed.

Employ appropriate software development process models, software development languages, methods and tools.	
Demonstrate critical understanding and consideration of legal, social, ethical and professional issues	
Employ appropriate configuration and quality management standards and procedures for both the software process and the developed software product.

Section 1: Completing your assessment 

Broadly speaking, the assignment entails collaborating within a group of 5 to 7 students to develop either a stand-alone, command-line, or web application for the hospital-based system outlined below, using any programming language of choice.

This assignment is collaborative.

For any questions regarding this assignment, please reach out to the teaching team via email or post them on the Assignment forum on Blackboard.

Below, you will find a basic description of a hospital system and a transcript of an interview between the software engineer and the hospital administrator. Your group's task is to design and implement an application for this hospital-based system.
1.Description of a Hospital System
A typical hospital has several wards divided into male wards and female wards. Each ward has a fixed number of beds. When a patient is admitted they are placed onto an appropriate ward. The doctors in the hospital are organised into teams such as Orthopedics A, or Pediatrics, and each team is headed by a consultant doctor. There must be at least one grade 1 junior doctor in each team. The Administration department keeps a record of these teams and the doctors allocated to each team. A patient on a ward is under the care of a single team of doctors, with the consultant being the person who is responsible for the patient. A record is maintained of who has treated the patient, and it must be possible to list the patients on a ward and the patients treated by a particular team.
2.Transcript of an interview between the Software Engineer and the Hospital Administrator
Now read thorough the transcript below of an interview between the Software Engineer (SE) and the Hospital Administrator (HA). The Software Engineer is trying to clarify the scope of the system and to determine the use cases that are needed.

SE: So let me just check what this system must do. You need to admit patients and discharge them, and you also need the system to be able to output various lists? 
 
HA: Yes, oh and also to record who has treated a patient.

SE: So the system needs to know about doctors and consultants too?,

HA: Yes that is right.

SE: Let me just get this clear, does this system also need to be able to record what treatment a patient has received?

HA: No, that is done by a separate medical records system, not by this system.

SE: OK, so let's look at something specific to this system. You initially need to admit a patient to a ward, which we talked about earlier, but does a patient always stay on the same ward? 

HA: No, not necessarily, sometimes we transfer patient between wards.

SE: What information needs to be provided when this happens?

HA: The administrator has to identify the patient, and then the ward they are being transferred to.

SE: Presumably the new ward has to be of the right type?

HA: Of course, and there must be room on it too.

SE: And what is recorded when a patient is transferred?

HA: That the patient is on the new ward.

SE: Is there any need to record that they used to be on a different ward? 

HA: No, not by this system.

SE: You mentioned some lists; tell me about what kind of information the system needs to output?

HA: We need a list of all the patients on a particular ward, and a list of all the patients cared for by a particular team.

SE: Let's take the first one first. What does that involve?

HA: The administrator identifies a particular ward and the patients' names and ages should be displayed. Perhaps the ward could be identified by selecting from a list of ward names?

SE: We'll bear that in mind, but we'll leave the details of the user interface until later. How about the second list?

HA: Well the administrator identifies a team and all the patients cared for by that team should be listed.
SE: And what do you need on this list?

HA: The patient's name and the name of the ward that the patient is on.

SE: So let's move on to what you need to do to record treatment. Do you need to know every doctor in a team who has actually treated the patient?

HA: Yes, we need the system to record this.

SE: What exactly does this entail?

HA: Well the administrator has to identify the patient, and the doctor (consultant or junior doctor) who has treated the patient, and the system should record that the doctor has treated the patient.

SE: But only doctors in the team that the patient is allocated to can treat the patient.

HA: Yes, that is right.

SE: OK, do you ever need to list exactly who has treated the patient?

HA: Yes, I forgot about that. For any particular patient we need to know the name of the consultant responsible for the patient, and the code of the team that is caring for the patient, as well as the name of each doctor who has treated the patient, and their grade if they are a junior doctor.

SE: Do you really need all of this information on this list? Surely if you know the code of the team you could have the system look up the name of the consultant doctor?

HA: Yes that is true, but it would be convenient to have it on the list.

SE: So tell me what happens when a patient leaves the hospital?

HA: Well we have a discharge process, and the discharged patient should be removed from this system.

SE: So what does the administrator do?

HA: Oh they should just tell the system which patient is to be discharged, and all information relating to that patient should be removed from the system.

SE: So you don't need any record of a patient once they are discharged?

HA: Well of course we keep their medical records, but not on this system, that is a totally different system.




Section 2: Deliverables
The group should submit a single Word document file (no pdfs allowed). This must be submitted on Blackboard.  The Word document file should take the following structure:

1.Introduction: Introduce the assessment and provide a summary of the project proposal and how you have progressed from the project proposal stage. 

2.Literature review: Provide a review of literature on both the existing system described in section 2, and other hospital management systems that you have researched as part of your feasibility study. This could include reviewing systems, methods and technologies used.    

3.Design and development: Discuss the design and development using the requirements you have gathered. Provide rationale for the decisions taken in your design and development. Design and development documentation should be presented in an appendix. Whilst you are NOT expected to code or produce a fully functioning system, if you decide to code you must include full source code in an appendix. If you have not produced code, then the appendix must include your algorithms/pseudocode.  You may use snippets from your appendices in the main body of the report, to illustrate specific points. 

4.Rationale for the groups overall technical approach: This section must provide an overview of the various different software development models your group considered using and discuss the rationale for your choice of a specific method over the others in the context of your project. Within the chosen model, you need to further discuss your choice and use of the specific techniques you have used in the project.
 	
5.Discussion: You should discuss how your overall approach, as described in the section above, differs from the formal SDLC.  How have you applied/not applied or deviated from the formal literature related to the SDLC/lectorial activities? 
For example, if you have not produced code in your project, you could discuss that fact that, although you have developed test plans based upon the requirements, you are not able to run those test plans to validate the system- thus deviating from the formal SDLC as described in the literature. 
 
6.A critical appraisal of the groups achievements: Do not focus on individual aspects in this section.  For example, what skills have you gained, and how might you use these skills in the future? Are there any limitations in what has been achieved by the group? Are there any things that the group particularly excelled at?

7.Group conduct and management: How did your group conduct itself throughout the module? Include evidences of group conduct and management. You could make references to Teams Files. Remember to provide examples. To what extent did the group embed SLEP (Social, Legal, Ethical and professional) aspects into the project.  

8.User acceptance test: Using a user acceptance model for the prototype/design, what might be the predicted outcome if this system were to be deployed in future. You are expected to use literature in this section to support your arguments.

9.Prototype: Where the group has not produced code, this could also include wireframe If the group decides to use wireframe, it must still adhere to the same rigour and process.   
 
Your final submission zip file for the group-based project need to contain the following:
- A named folder containing the contribution of each team member (e.g., John Forest_Group1_Contribution)
- A folder containing final / complete deliverables for each unique project group (e.g. Group1_Final Deliverables). This should be well organised for easy access for the module team.


Submit a zip file of your implementation for the hospital system. This must be submitted on Blackboard at 2.00pm. The zip file should contain what is described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 below.

      2.1  A .doc/.docx file containing a brief discussion of your implementation choices

A .doc/.docx file containing a brief discussion of your implementation choices. The discussion should include a description of the limitations of your implementation, any alternatives that you considered and discarded and the rationale for your solution. Please ensure that you use the format for this that has been discussed in class.

Section 3: About the assessment

Where should I start?

As part of this module's requirements, you are required to schedule weekly meetings to discuss the progress of your group and outline the roles and responsibilities for each group member. Additionally, you should prepare a project proposal that includes the problem statement, Gantt chart, and risk plan. This will enable the group to monitor the progress of the project development in an appropriate manner.

What do I need to do to pass? 

To successfully complete the module, a minimum score of 50% or higher is required (as stated in Section 5: Marking Criteria).
